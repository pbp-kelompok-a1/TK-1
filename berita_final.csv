Avani Lekhara says Paris 2024 will “always hold a special place in my heart”,"One year since winning her second Paralympic gold medal, Indian shooting Para sport star Avani Lekhara celebrated the special milestone, saying Paris 2024 will “always hold a special place in my heart.”
“I can’t believe it’s one year since Paris 2024,” she said in a @Paralympics Instagram Broadcast Channel takeover. “Paris was super special for me as I went in as a defending champion. It was a mix of lows and excitement.”
Lekhara was one of roughly 4,400 athletes who competed at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, which took place from 28 August – 8 September. She won one of India’s seven gold medals at the Games.
Lekhara took over the @Paralympics Instagram Broadcast Channel on 30 August 2025, the day that holds deep personal meaning for her.
“A fun fact – both my Tokyo gold and my Paris gold happened on the same exact day, 30 August, three years apart. It feels kind of meant to be, right?”
At Tokyo 2020, she became the first-ever female athlete from India to top the podium at a Paralympic Games. She was just 19 and arrived in the Japanese capital thinking it would be an opportunity to gain experience competing against the world’s best.
She made history, winning gold in the R2 – women's 10m air rifle standing SH1 event and later claimed bronze in the R8 – women's 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 event.
Three years later, she took to the range at Chateauroux Shooting Centre as the defending champion, with more spotlight and added pressure. She scored 249.7 points in the R2 – women's 10m air rifle standing SH1 event, finishing 2.9 points ahead of Republic of Korea’s Yunri Lee. Lekhara was joined on the podium by fellow Indian Mona Agarwal, who captured bronze.
Her victory at Paris 2024 was emotional and unforgettable. Just like at Tokyo 2020, where she made her Paralympic debut, her mother was by her side.
“My mother has been my lucky charm, with me on both the special days three years apart,” Lekhara explained.
She said that her day got even busier after winning gold with many interview requests from Indian and international media. But at the end of the day, she had time to embrace her accomplishment, she said, posting a photo of her gold medal resting on her bedside table next to the Paris 2024 mascot Phryge, capturing a quiet moment of celebration in her own space.
Beyond her achievements on the range, Lekhara hopes her journey can encourage others to look beyond disability and believe in their own potential.
“I really hope that people will take away from my journey that ability matters more than disability,” she said. “If I can do this, honestly, anyone can go after their dreams too.”
“That’s what I want people to feel when they see my story.”
Lekhara, who sustained a spinal cord injury as a result of an accident in 2012, also emphasised the importance of improving accessibility and fostering inclusion around the world.
“Don’t add inclusion later, inclusion can’t be an afterthought,” she said.
“Build it from the start. Paris showed us how powerful it is when everything is already accessible. It makes such a difference for athletes like me. That is the kind of world I’d like to see.”

Best of the Para archery World Championships in Gwangju,"The biannual Para archery World Championships, which took place from 22-28 September, in Gwangju, Korea, was packed with great competition.
A year after the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, China dominated the overall medals table again, claiming a total of 12 medals including six gold. Two-time Paralympic champion Tianxin Zhang topped the podium three times.
Yet, China also lost several high-profile matches, which was proof of the high level of competition in Gwangju.
The biggest breakthrough? A Mongolian recurve effort that took two team golds – both featuring Demberel Selengee, after the nation’s previous best was a single world team bronze.
It propelled Mongolia to an astonishing third on the medals table, finishing above Turkiye, Korea, Czechia, Italy and the USA. Sheetal Devi and Toman Kumar won the women’s and men’s compound open events, respectively, to lead India to second plan on the table.
Who were the biggest stars of the seven-day World Championships? Get to know the three performances that surprised and delighted us the most in Gwangju.
Sheetal Devi took down her second major in Gwangju, after her win at the Hangzhou 2022 Asian Para Games, beating reigning World and Paralympic Champion Oznur Cure Girdi for the compound title.
“I had a dream I would become world champion,” said Devi. “It made me want to work. I worked and worked and today I’ve got such a good result.”
Well-known for being inspired by and the protege of Matt Stutzman, Devi is already going someway to match his achievements – not just on finals fields, but in inspiring and motivating others to push past boundaries.
She shot to stardom after winning her first major title at the 2022 Asian Games. Silver at Pilsen 2023 Worlds and mixed team bronze at Paris 2024 followed, making her no stranger to the sport’s biggest podiums.
The match in Gwangju was a repeat of the 2023 World Championship final. Tied after the first end, the match pivoted on the second, which Devi cleaned while Girdi dropped three points. That swing proved decisive, as the Indian maintained her advantage until the finish.
“The pressure wasn’t great,” Devi said. “I controlled myself and shot very calmly. My heartbeat wasn’t so fast, so there was less pressure. It felt amazing just to be in the finals again.”
While Wu Chunyan has not quite fully dominated her era, in Gwangju she achieved something unique in the history of Para archery. No athlete had ever won four world titles with the same bow until Wu did so on Sunday, 28 September, delivering possibly the finest performance of the day.
Wu, who has won two gold medals across three Paralympic Games, used all her experience to overcome her much younger teammate in the women’s recurve open final.
Not everything went her way in Gwangju (she lost two team semifinals), but she won every finals match she entered and gleefully punished opponent errors. She earned bronze in the women’s recurve open doubles and recurve mixed team.
She has now won eight world titles, more than any other Para archer. Only the Asian Para Championships remain for her to complete the set.
Age is just a number, but in Kim Ok Geum’s case, it makes her achievement all the more remarkable. The 65-year-old world No. 3 in women’s W1, who spent most of her career in compound, won her first world title at Gwangju in the women’s doubles team event with Lee Eunhee, on home soil, and one splashed widely across Korean media.
Kim only began archery in her fifties, yet an unprecedented willingness to work and compete at the very highest level has led her to multiple team and individual medals ever since her international debut in 2014, including a Paralympic silver team medal. She placed fourth in Paris 2024, competing as one of the oldest Paralympians.
It goes to show that attitude is everything in sport.
“It’s my first gold medal at the World Championships, so it’s even more precious, and I was moved to tears during the awards ceremony as I remembered the difficult training I went through,"" she told Korean news.
“It was especially encouraging that the mayor and the sports association staff came to cheer me on. I will do my best to achieve good results at the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games.”
She is just getting started.

New Delhi 2025: Indian Paralympic stars to watch,"More than 70 athletes are set to represent India when the country hosts its first-ever World Para Athletics Championships at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. New Delhi 2025, held from 27 September to 5 October, will be the biggest Para sport competition ever staged in India.
India captured 84 medals at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, including 17 in Para athletics. Since making their Paralympic debut at Tel Aviv 1968, Indian athletes have earned eight gold medals in the sport.
At the Kobe 2024 World Para Athletics Championships, Indian athletes bagged 17 medals and they are aiming to make New Delhi 2025 their most successful World Championships yet.
With this historic event approaching, get to know the Paris 2024 Paralympic champions and a multi-medallist who are ready to wow the home crowd in the Indian capital.
Sumit is one of India’s biggest stars in Para athletics, having won back-to-back Paralympic gold medals in the men’s javelin F64. His breakthrough came at Tokyo 2020, where he shattered the world record three times in the final en route to claiming his maiden gold medal.
He hasn’t stopped since. He topped the podium at Paris 2024 with a throw of 70.59 metres. He holds the world record of 73.29 metres, set at the Hangzhou 2022 Asian Para Games in October 2023.
Sumit, who lost his left leg in a road accident in 2015, discovered javelin throwing in 2017. “I’ve taken so many decisions in the gap between 2015 and 2017. But the best decision was to join Para sport,” he has said. The two-time Paralympic champion is ready to take the spotlight once again — this time at the first World Championships on home soil.
Preeti Pal shot to stardom at Paris 2024 and was selected as India’s flagbearer for the Closing Ceremony, alongside Para archery champion Harvinder Singh. She will carry India’s flag once again, this time at the Opening Ceremony of New Delhi 2025.
Pal became the star of the Indian delegation in Paris, becoming the only athlete to win multiple medals in Para athletics. She claimed bronze in the women’s 100m and 200m T35 on her Paralympic debut.
The double bronze medallist from the Kobe 2024 World Championships is aiming to upgrade her medals in New Delhi.
Praveen Kumar won gold in the men’s high jump T64 with a jump of 2.08 metres, three years after claiming silver at Tokyo 2020. New Delhi 2025 will be his fourth World Championships; he earned bronze at Paris 2023.
Kumar says Para sport is the “best opportunity” for people with disabilities. Competing in front of a crowd motivates him and boosts his self-confidence. What will he achieve in front of a roaring home crowd?
Dharambir captured his maiden Paralympic gold at Paris 2024 in the men’s club throw F51. Competing at his third Games, he threw 34.92 metres, finishing 0.33 ahead of countryman Pranav Soorma. Bronze medallist Zeljko Dimitrijevic also shared the podium in Paris.
At New Delhi 2025, the two Indian athletes are set to face off again. Dharambir has also been named flagbearer for the home delegation.
Navdeep missed out on the podium on his Paralympic debut at Tokyo 2020, finishing fourth in the men’s javelin F41. But he came back stronger at Paris 2024, winning gold and helping India achieve its most successful Paralympic Games.
“I am feeling very happy to have won one more medal for my country,” he said on Instagram after the Games. “A lot of people have supported me in this journey. I want to thank everyone for their support.”
Having finished third at the Kobe 2024 World Championships, Navdeep is chasing his first World Championship gold in the Indian capital.

6 months to Milano Cortina 2026: Athletes share dream pizzas and hopes for the Games,"Today (6 September 2025) marks six months until the Milano Cortina 2026 Paralympic Winter Game, and athletes are celebrating the milestone by sharing their dream pizzas. Italian Para athletes and some of the world’s top Para ice hockey players joined in to share their favourite toppings and what excites them most about competing at the Games.
The Milano Cortina 2026 Paralympic Winter Games, which open on 6 March 2026, will welcome up to 665 athletes from around 50 delegations. They will compete for gold in 79 medal events across six sports: Para alpine skiing, Para biathlon, Para cross-country, Para ice hockey, Para snowboard, and wheelchair curling.
Milano Cortina 2026 will mark the 50th anniversary of the first Paralympic Winter Games and also see the Games return to Italy for the second time in history, 20 years after Torino 2006.
Beyond pizza, Italian athletes Giacomo Bertagnolli, Gabriele Lanza and Andrea Macri shared their hopes, preparations and the reasons why they are excited about the Milano Cortina 2026 Paralympics.
Four-time Paralympic champion Giacomo Bertagnolli is gearing up for his third Winter Games. This time, the stage is set in his own backyard. Living just two hours from the Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre in Cortina, he is preparing to compete on the very mountains that shaped his career.
“It’s six months to go to Milano Cortina 2026 so we don’t have too much time. I’m trying to stay calm,” the 26-year-old athlete said. “I’m starting to feel that the event is almost here.”
After a brief summer break, Bertagnolli is back on skis this month, feeling more prepared compared to six months before PyeongChang 2018 and Beijing 2022. But with the Games approaching, he says the challenge is not just physical, but it is also emotional.
“For Milano Cortina, the most difficult part will be keeping my emotions. It’s one of my goals to remain calm and enjoy the Games.”
Here are two things that Bertagnolli is excited about:
1. Winning and celebrating at home
The eight-time Paralympic medallist says that winning a medal at Milano Cortina 2026 will be more special than any other medals he has claimed so far in his career.
“I’m at home and I always train here. I feel different skiing here because there are my mountains here,” he said.
While he has not given thought about his celebration plans yet, he says it will likely involve a “huge party” in the square outside his house, followed by a trip around the world.
2. More visibility of Para sport
Bertagnolli hopes his performance will help the growth of Para sport in Italy. The Italian star, who was not aware of the Paralympic Games when he was young, wants to inspire the next generation of Paralympians to take up sports.
“I would like to do great (at Milano Cortina 2026) not just for me, but also for people or kids with disabilities, who want to start competing at the Paralympic Games. That would be a great opportunity.”
Gabriele Lanza is balancing two roles: Para ice hockey player and logistics co-ordinator for the Milano Cortina 2026 Organising Committee. He is one of the three Para ice hockey players working to put on the Games.
With six months to go, he has noticed the excitement building in Italy.
“A lot of people started talking about Milano Cortina 2026 because it’s so near,” he said. “I am really excited… I want to understand what it is like to play at a Paralympic Games with all the Italian people in the arena.”
Here are two things that Lanza is excited about:
1. Para athletes taking Italy by storm
Milano Cortina 2026 promises athletic feats and historic moments, set against the stunning backdrop of Italy’s beautiful landscapes. It promises to be the most breathtaking Paralympic Winter Games yet.
Even better, Lanza is excited to compete in front of a huge home crowd. After attending Beijing 2022, which took place without spectators because of the Covid-19 pandemic, he is eager to feel the energy of fans at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, where eight teams will battle for glory.
He is also looking forward to the “pressure” that comes with competing at home and being in the media spotlight.
2. Pizza in the Paralympic Village?
Lanza is confident that the Italian food served in the Paralympic Village will be one of the highlights for athletes. Will the menu also include the dream pizzas athletes created in the video?
Veteran Para ice hockey player Andrea Macri is preparing for his fifth Paralympic Winter Games while also working as a member of the Organising Committee.
Having made his Paralympic debut in wheelchair fencing  at London 2012, he knows just how much work goes into competing on the biggest stage.
“There is nothing bigger than the Paralympic Games,” Macri said. “I can’t wait for that moment. It has been a long journey and there’s still a long journey to go.
“It’s a really critical period for us, the Italian team,” he said. “I can’t wait to finally start the Games, be there and join the atmosphere.”
Here are two things that Macri is excited about:
1. Energy of the Italian public
Macri is looking forward to the enthusiasm of the Italian public, especially the volunteers who have applied to support the Games.
“It will be in Italy, and I love my country. We will have a lot of things to offer. People in Italy, we are counting on their energy.”
2. Lasting legacy of the historic Games
Macri, who works as Legacy Manager for the Organising Committee, has high hopes for the lasting impact of Milano Cortina 2026. From improved accessibility in historic venues to shifting perceptions of disability across the country, he believes the Games will leave a significant legacy.
“This is the opportunity of having the Paralympic Games in our country,” Macri said. “We have a lot of old buildings and infrastructure; this made the challenge bigger. But this shows to the whole world that if we can do it, they can do it.”

Sydney 2000 anniversary: Bridie Kean says Games showed that “sport is for all of us”,"Twenty-five years ago, 13-year-old Bridie Kean was watching the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games from the stands with her support group for children with disabilities, thinking for the first time that sport could be something she could pursue.
It opened the door to many possibilities for Kean, now a two-time Paralympic wheelchair basketball medallist who has also played a role in Brisbane’s bid to host the Paralympic and Olympic Games in 2032.
“It just blew me away once I got to Sydney. It was such a transformational experience to be in Sydney and to watch the athletes,” Kean recalled.
“For many of us, who had not yet engaged in Para sport, it was just life changing in that we saw the real possibility to play Para sport, let alone go to the Paralympics.""
Sydney 2000, held from 18–29 October 2000, featured 3,871 athletes from more than 120 delegations competing in 19 sports. With more than 300 world and Paralympic records broken, the Games showcased the rising standards in level Para sport.
Australian athletes took the spotlight on home soil, finishing atop the overall medals table with 63 golds. The Games also made a tremendous impact outside the field of play – inspiring many children with disabilities, including Kean, to take up sport.
Looking back at the 11-day Games, Kean says she has memories of watching many sports, from Para athletics at the Sydney Olympic Park to cheering for Para swimmers at the International Aquatic Centre. Whenever she saw Australian Paralympians, she and her friend Kathleen O’Kelly-Kennedy asked them to sign their T-shirts or prosthetic legs to keep as memorabilia.
But the encounter that changed her life took place at the wheelchair basketball venue. The group was watching the Australian men’s wheelchair basketball team compete when they were approached by Liesl Tesch, a star player on the women’s team, the Gliders.
Tesch, who helped the Gliders win silver at Sydney 2000, shared what it was like to play wheelchair basketball and what it meant to be an Australian Paralympian. Seeing that Kean and O’Kelly-Kennedy had prosthetic legs, she encouraged them to give the sport a try.
“I will always remember to this day,” Kean said. “She just said, ‘go home and start wheelchair basketball’ – and that just stuck with me.
“Up until that moment I had played able-bodied basketball and I wanted to play with my peers. Then in that moment, I wanted to be a Glider. I wanted to be on that team, and it was an absolute dream.”
Soon after returning home, her parents found a local tournament, and she tried playing in a wheelchair. Kean fell in love with the sport right away, and the wheelchair basketball community became her second home.
She remembers practicing dribbling in a wheelchair in her driveway and taking the chair to school to make it part of her daily life.
Kean also kept in touch with Tesch, who returned to Australia after playing in Europe. Her hero became her friend and mentor.
“She taught me how to juggle wheelchair basketball with life and just this philosophy of chasing wheelchair basketball games and loving what we do,” Kean said.
They also became teammates on the national team, winning bronze at Beijing 2008. Four years later, Kean captained the team to silver at London 2012.
“I can’t believe that in 25 years, we’ve had the opportunity to play for Australia together, to medal together. It’s also what it means to be a Glider – it’s such a special programme to be a part of.”
Since retiring from the national team after Australia failed to qualify for Rio 2016, Kean became a leading sports administrator in the country. Like the saying “Once a Glider, always a Glider,” wheelchair basketball and Para sport hold an important place for her.
She is currently a lecturer in public health at the University of the Sunshine Coast. Her research explores how to create equitable opportunities to and through sport and physical activity for persons with disabilities.
She is also a Director of the Australian Sports Commission, which is the Australian government agency responsible for supporting and investing in sport at all levels.
Being involved in Para sport for 25 years now, Kean sees the growth of sport in the country. There is more awareness and more programmes that support persons with disabilities to access sport.
“When I was 13, I hadn’t seen any Para sport played out until I went to the Games. Now, we have such incredible coverage of the Games.
“Even when it’s not Games time, we have so much support in Australia for Para athletes and the Paralympic pathway. There are more options to be engaged in different sports. It has been exciting.
“Also people know Paralympic athletes’ names, and they know about the sports. The awareness means that people already know about (the Games) before it comes around every four years.”
Now Australia is preparing to welcome thousands of Para athletes and fans when the Brisbane 2032 Paralympic Games open on 24 August 2032. While there are still seven years to go, Kean has already been thinking about the legacy of the Games and how it could improve the lives of persons with disabilities.
“I want people with a disability who want to engage in sport to have more options as a result of hosting the Games. I think that’s what we’re seeing already through additional support.
“Sport is a unifier, it’s something that brings us together. I draw back to my own experience of what it was like to find sport. I want kids to have the option to play sport too.”
When asked to share a message with her teenage self, Kean looks back at her years in the Paralympic Movement in Australia and looks ahead to Brisbane 2032.
“I guess the thing about Sydney is, when I look back at the 13-year-old who arrived in Sydney and maybe [was] not sure that sport had a place for me - the message is: it does,” Kean said. “Liesl with her time and having that one-on-one interaction with me made me realise that.
“But I want and I think Brisbane can do this. I think Brisbane sends that message widely to everyone with a disability that you do have a place in sport. You belong. Sport is for all of us.”",https://www.paralympic.org/feature/sydney-2000-bridie-kean-sport-all-us,paralympic.org,admin,
Vitor Tavares wants to inspire next generation of Para athletes,"Vitor Goncalves Tavares became a national sensation in Brazil following his historic bronze medal in Para badminton at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games. It was the nation’s first ever Olympic or Paralympic medal in badminton.
Back-to-back men’s singles gold medals at Para Badminton International tournaments in Dubai and Bahrain in May have set the momentum for Tavares, and he hopes to continue in the same vein at the World Championships scheduled to take place in Bahrain next year.
“My short-term goal is to change the colour of my medal at the World Championships. I’m training very hard towards that,” said the seven-time World Championships medallist.
His success is a testament to determination, hard work, and unwavering discipline — transforming Tavares from a little-known player into Brazil’s most celebrated Para badminton star.
At Paris 2024, he beat Man Kai Chu 2-1 in the bronze medal match of the men's singles SH6 event en route to making history in his second Paralympic appearance.
“I never imagined how much a medal could change lives – not just mine, but of so many young people who now see badminton as their future now.
“People know me more and about my sport, they recognise me saying that ‘Oh! I saw you on TV!’” said Tavares who was amazed to see the growth in youngsters picking up the sport.
Since his historic medal, Tavares has embarked on a new mission – to inspire the next generation through sport.
The 28-year-old Para badminton star has been visiting schools across the country, sharing his remarkable journey of resilience, discipline, and dedication.
“It’s a proud feeling but with this, responsibility comes along. I want to give the best lessons to these kids who look up to me as their inspiration.
“Visiting schools and witnessing the excitement in young faces about learning about the sport has been one of the most rewarding parts of the journey,” added Tavares, who resides in Curitiba – the capital of the southern Brazilian state of Parana.
The Paris 2024 medal not only made him a household name, it sparked a surge in badminton’s popularity across the country known for its passion for football.
There has been significant growth at the grassroots level, with over 180 athletes now competing at the national level.
The Brazilian Paralympic Committee and the Brazil Badminton Federation (CBBd) have been working closely to develop the sport with development programmes, national events and regular training camps planned in the lead-up to upcoming international competitions.
“Unlike many Asian countries, Brazil doesn’t have the badminton culture. But in the last few years, it has been growing and Tavares’ Paralympic medal has definitely helped spark the popularity of the game across Brazil and Pan America region,” said Italo Hauer, his long-time coach and now head coach of the Brazilian Para badminton team.
Hauer highlighted that Tavares’ discipline has been the striking feature of his personality.
“His discipline has been his strength over the years. After Tokyo 2020 we had a lot of discussion – listing out the aspects he needs to improve. Tavares made sure to keep a check on the list and make improvements over the time.
“In the last three years, his development in terms of his game and as a person has been amazing. He not just became a better player but definitely a better person.”
There were also other traits that Tavares has developed over the years.
Since Tokyo 2020 Games – where he missed out on a medal after losing the bronze medal match to Great Britain’s Krysten Coombs – Tavares has been working on various aspects of his game, especially on his mental strength.
“The first thing I have been working is on my mind – to keep my mind calm and just play — don’t think about anything and I’m able to take the tough calls during matches,” he said. “I always want to bring out my best performance – play a game without mistakes.”

Wheelchair curling legend Ina Forrest sets sights on Milano Cortina 2026,"After each Paralympic Winter Games, Canadian wheelchair curler Ina Forrest asks herself the same question: “Am I prepared to go on for four more years?”
She has asked it more than once. After her debut at Vancouver 2010, she thought, “I’m going to make it to one more.” Four years later, she told herself, “It’s only four years to one more Games.”
And after each subsequent Games, the question returned: “Should I quit this year?” But the answer always came quickly: “Well, what else am I going to do?”
Forrest has competed at four Paralympic Winter Games, finishing on the podium every time. She was a driving force behind Canada’s gold medal wins at Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014, and helped secure bronze medals at PyeongChang 2018 and Beijing 2022.
Now, 15 years after her Paralympic debut, and more than 20 years since she first threw a curling stone, Forrest is hoping to represent Canada  again at the Milano Cortina 2026 Paralympic Winter Games.
“After every Paralympics, you reassess where you are. Are you prepared to go on for another four years? And so far, it’s been a yes,” the 64-year-old athlete said.
“I just love being an athlete. I love going to the Paralympics, being part of the big Canadian team, not just the curling team, but all the other athletes, and performing on the biggest stage there is for Paralympic sport.”
Canada has secured a slot in the mixed team event at Milano Cortina 2026, which will take place from 6–15 March 2026. The Games will return to Italy for the first time since Torino 2006, where wheelchair curling made its Paralympic debut.
For the first time, wheelchair curling mixed doubles will also be featured at the Games.
Forrest, who has used a wheelchair since her 20s, was introduced to wheelchair curling in 2004 when a local Para athlete approached her while she was shopping and encouraged her to give it a try. Initially, she thought it might be a way to pass a few afternoons while her three children were at school.
But the sport quickly became much more. After not making the team for Torino 2006, she created a five-year plan to become a Paralympian.
Her breakthrough came at the Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Winter Games, where she played in front of a home crowd. Canada entered the Games as defending champions.
“The first Paralympics was all the unknowns and all the uncertainties. Being in my home province as well as my home country, I was concerned I’d be too nervous and wouldn't be able to perform,” Forrest recalled.
“But I remember going into the Opening Ceremony and feeling the cascade of noise hit us. It pounded in your chest, everybody cheering as we came in. It was so incredible.”
Canada defended their gold medal, defeating Korea in the final.
“I can see why big sports teams like playing in front of their hometown fans. It’s such huge support. That’s what we had the whole event - so many people in the arenas and cheering fans.”
“To win the gold medal in front of family and friends, well, how can you top that?”
Forrest has competed in three more Games since Vancouver, finishing on the podium each time. What keeps her going?
She says the beauty of wheelchair curling lies in the need to constantly evolve.
“It never seems like you can figure it all out. Just when you think you have, maybe we add a new piece of equipment and change things up, or you play on a different ice surface, or play with rocks that react differently,” she said.
“Wheelchair curling is a dynamic and evolving sport. You constantly have to keep up with where other teams are, what they’re doing, and how good they’re getting to stay competitive.”
One of her key learnings this year came at the World Wheelchair Mixed Doubles Curling Championship in Stevenston, Scotland. The World Championship was part of the qualification process for the inaugural Paralympic mixed doubles competition.
Teaming up with three-time Paralympian Mark Ideson, Forrest aimed to help Canada earn a slot for Milano Cortina 2026. The duo started strong but were upset by Japan in the quarterfinals.
Japan’s pair of Aki Ogawa and Yoji Nakajima went on to win the tournament, defeating Scotland 11–2 in the final. Estonia claimed bronze, while Canada finished sixth.
Although Canada did not secure a mixed doubles slot, Forrest is excited to see the event’s inclusion and its potential to grow the sport.
“We are seeing a lot more countries that are entering into wheelchair curling,” she said.
“With mixed doubles, it’s a lot easier for countries to find two curlers. More countries are playing and being able to go to higher level competitions. And once they go there, (athletes) learn so much from all the other players and by watching competitors around them.""
With six months to go until Milano Cortina 2026, Forrest is back in training with the Canadian team.
She has a packed schedule ahead: competitions in Switzerland and Scotland in October, followed by the Czech Republic in November, and events in Canada in January and training camps for the Games.
“Six months sounds like a lot of time, but you know it's going to go by really quickly,” she said.
“We are just starting our season, and you want everything to go well. But you also know you need to get the practice in because you’re not 100 per cent your best playing self just yet.”
Forrest hopes to compete on Italian ice for the first time in her 20-year career. She has only visited Italy twice, most recently for a birthday trip with friends when she turned 50.
“I’m really looking forward (to Milano Cortina 2026) because we’ve never curled in Italy before. I’ve played against Italy from the very start of my experience in curling, but never in Italy.”
“This will be a first and a very exciting time.”

Andrew Parsons re-elected IPC President for third and final term,"Andrew Parsons was re-elected President of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) for a third and final four-year term at the 2025 IPC General Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, on Saturday (27 September).
The Brazilian received 109 of the 177 valid votes to be chosen over fellow presidential candidate Dong Hyun Bae of South Korea who received 68 votes.
“I’m really happy, I think it shows the confidence and the trust of the IPC membership with the direction of where we are going with the Paralympic Movement,” said IPC President Andrew Parsons. “From a personal point of view, being able to finish things that I started in 2017 when I was first elected, but also the opportunity to initiate new projects, open new doors and new fronts in my last four years will be incredible. I’m grateful to the Paralympic family for this wonderful opportunity.
“I’m feeling a mixture of joy, happiness, and pride, but overall, I want to thank from the bottom of my heart the trust the IPC membership has placed in me. I’m immensely excited for the next four years.”
Parsons, the former President of the Brazilian Paralympic Committee and Americas Paralympic Committee, was first elected to the IPC Governing Board in 2009. Before becoming the IPC’s third President in 2017, he served as Vice-President between 2013 and 2017.
During his first eight years as President, Parsons secured a long-term partnership with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) through to 2032 and changed the IPC’s strategic direction. Today, in addition to strengthening member organisations and delivering exceptional Paralympic Games, the IPC showcases the impact the Paralympic Movement’s activities have on driving social inclusion.
Parsons successfully steered the Paralympic Movement through the pandemic and has overseen the successful delivery of the Tokyo 2020, PyeongChang 2018, Beijing 2022 and Paris 2024 Paralympic Games. The Paris 2024 Paralympic Games were the “most spectacular” in history setting several new benchmarks and attracting a record number of NPCs and athletes.
At the 2025 IPC General Assembly, IPC member organisations made up of National Paralympic Committees, International Federations and International Organisations of Sport for the Disabled also elected Portugal’s Leila Marques Mota First Vice-President and Denmark’s John Petersson as Second Vice-President. The pair succeed New Zealand’s Duane Kale who served the maximum number of terms as IPC Governing Board member and could not stand for re-election.
Leila Marques Mota is Vice-President of the Portuguese Paralympic Committee and serves on the Executive and Directors Board of the Portuguese Sports Foundation. A four-time Paralympian in Para swimming, Leila was appointed Chef de Mission of the Portuguese team for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games and previously chaired the Women in Sport Commission of the Portuguese Olympic Committee. She is a medical doctor with a degree from the University of Lisbon and holds a Postgraduate Diploma in Sports Medicine from the IOC.
Leila Marques Mota, IPC First Vice-President said: “I feel very good and deeply honoured to be elected Vice President of the IPC. I thank all the members that trusted me and feel that I will be able to do a good job.
“I hope I can deliver what I promised. I want to serve with active listening, integrity, transparency and close connection to everyone so all the members and all the athletes can feel listened to and equally represented at the IPC.”
John Petersson is a five-time Paralympian in Para swimming, who represented Denmark from 1984 to 2000, winning 15 medals.
He served two-terms as IPC Governing Member-at-Large between 2013-2017 and 2021-2025, and is currently a member of the IPC Audit, Risk and Finance Board Sub-Committee. His governance career began in 2000 and in 2005 he became Vice-President of NPC Denmark before assuming the Presidency, a role he still holds, in 2018.  Petersson served as President of the European Paralympic Committee from 2009 to 2017 and chaired the IPC Regions Council and the Supervisory Board of the Agitos Foundation.
John Petersson IPC Second Vice-President said: “I’m absolutely blown away to be elected the IPC’s Second Vice-President. It’s quite amazing and I have worked hard for many years to achieve this. I was first on the Board in 2013, then I was away for four years and now I’m the Vice-President, so it feels fantastic.
“The members really contributed with their knowledge and energy, all the conversations I had with them about their aspirations have been really energising and I’m truly grateful for their support.”
The IPC General Assembly decided to adjourn after the first round of the elections for Members-at-Large due to time constraints. The election of the Members-at-large to the IPC Governing Board will continue at the earliest possible opportunity. The IPC will convene a remote Extraordinary General Assembly for this purpose in accordance with the IPC Constitution.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/andrew-parsons-re-elected-ipc-president-third-and-final-term,paralympic.org,admin,

"Brno 2025 Para Trap World Championships: Preview, top stars and how to watch","The seventh edition of the World Shooting Para Sport (WSPS) Para Trap World Championships will be held in Brno, Czechia this weekend (13-14 September) with 66 athletes from 22 nations competing at the Shotgun Shooting Range for the Olympic Disciplines Skeet and Trap Brno.
This will be the largest-ever Para Trap World Championships and the first to take place in Czechia, with a record number of countries and female athletes taking part in all three classes (PT1 – SG-S, PT2 – SG-L and PT3 – SG-U).
📺 Watch Live: Brno 2025 will be streamed live on the ISSF YouTube channel and the WSPS Facebook page.
Complete schedule and results are available here.
“Brno will host the largest WSPS Para Trap World Championships to date, with a record number of participant nations and female athletes,” said Tyler Anderson, World Shooting Para Sport Senior Manager.
“The Organising Committee has warmly welcomed some of the world’s best since 2020, hosting an annual Grand Prix that has become one of the most established events in the international Para trap circuit. In 2025, it hosted the sixth edition of the GP, with many of the stars competing at the World Championships.”
Anderson added:
“Brno also held the first WSPS international event when competition resumed following the COVID-19 pandemic, showcasing its capacity, experience and strong commitment to shooting Para sport. We are looking forward to a fantastic World Championships.”
There will be six gold medals up for grabs – three individual and three team events.
Here are the top names on each of them.
Spain’s Pedro Gomez Albendea will be defending his world title from Granada 2024 against home favourite Jaroslav Klimes, who put Czechia on the Para Trap World Championships podium for the first time with his PT1 bronze medal last year.
Martin Bartos and Roman Telicka are the other Czech athletes in the event. Bartos picked a silver medal at the International Sellier & Bellot WSPS Grand Prix last month, finishing behind Murat Pelit of Switzerland – who is also competing in the Worlds.
The event will also see in action two other PT1 world champions, Davide Fedrigucci of Italy (Lima 2023) and Neofytos Nikolay of Cyprus (Lonato 2021). The 2021 world champion in the PT3 class, Italy’s Emilio Poli will make his World Championships debut in the PT1.
Finland’s two-time world champion Vesa Jarvinen (Lonato 2018 and Al Ain 2022) has only missed out on the podium twice since the inaugural edition at Lonato 2018.
He took the bronze medal last year in Granada and will be up against 2024 gold medallist Filip Marinov of Slovakia and silver medallist Fabrizio Cormons of Italy.
Cormon is also the 2023 world champion. Other previous gold medallists vying for a new title in Czechia are Italy’s Alessandro Spagnoli (Sydney 2019) and Spain’s Ignacio Javier Oloriz (Lonato 2021). Spangoli also won last month’s GP in Brno.
Italy's Giulia Vernatta will also compete in the PT2 class. She is one of seven female shooters at Brno 2025 and one of two representing the strong Italian team, alongside Maria Mirabile.
Italy has claimed PT3 gold in all previous six World Championships and the last three had the same winner, Gabrielle Nanni. He comes to Brno as the name to beat, having picked another triumph at the WSPS World Cup in Changwon, South Korea earlier this year.
Brazil’s Alexandro Basso picked a bronze medal in Changwon, putting his country on the podium for the first time in a Para Trap World Cup. He will also be in action in Brno, alongside Changwon silver medallist Ahmad Buhaleeba of UAE – Lima 2023 World Championships bronze.
Spain’s Adrian Castillo Becker and Italy’s Mirko Caffagi will be keen to change the colour of their medals, following their silver and bronze, respectively, in Granada last year.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/brno-2025-para-trap-world-championships-preview,paralympic.org,admin,
Brno 2025: Madran shines as Para Trap Worlds sees world record and historic firsts,"Brno became the stage for breakthrough performances, historic firsts and continued dominance at the 2025 WSPS Para Trap World Championships over the weekend (13-14 September) in Czechia.
Just one month after earning his first World Shooting Para Sport medal at the WSPS Brno Grand Prix, 16-year-old Muaz Erdem Madran of Turkyie returned to Brno to make history as the youngest world champion in Para trap.
Madran claimed gold in the PT3 standing mixed SG-U event, hitting 41 targets – three more than Italy’s Gabriele Nanni, who was aiming for a fourth consecutive world title.
“I’m so happy. I didn’t expect this,” said the Turkish athlete, who received his trophy from Czech Olympic trap medallist David Kostelecky.
Spain’s Meliton Brinas Mora completed the podium with 30 hits, marking his return to the top three after four years.
In PT1 (seated mixed SG-S), Mohammed Alhebsi not only put the United Arab Emirates on the top of the podium for the first time in seven editions of the Para Trap Worlds, but he did it in style with a world record of 41 hits.
A bronze medallist from Lonato 2021, Alhebsi had qualified in fifth place but dominated the final from the start, improving by one target the previous record set by Spain’s Pedro Gomez Albendea at the 2022 Munich WSPS World Cup.
“It’s an honour to give UAE the gold medal for first time. I already had a World Championships medal, but this was different. It is a fantastic feeling,” Alhebsi said.
The PT1 final saw more history being made. Switzerland’s Murat Pelit overcame an inconsistent start to secure his country’s first-ever World Championships medal, finishing second with 33 shots made.
Czechia’s Jaroslav Klimes (28 hits) repeated his bronze medal performance from Granada 2024, this time with added emotion as he competed in front of his family and home crowd.
“The medal was really special, my son was here to watch me. The atmosphere was great, I am really happy,” Klimes said.
France’s Hella Lajili also put her name in history with a fourth-place finish, the best ever by a female athlete at the Para Trap World Championships. She narrowly missed the podium by one point, despite topping the qualification round with 103 shots.
Italy’s Fabrizio Cormons ensured his country’s golden streak remained intact with a PT2 standing mixed SG-L title. After missing all targets in the opening round, he staged a remarkable comeback, culminating in a perfect final round with 10 out of 10 to edge France’s Cyril Delubac by one (40-39).  It was Cormon’s third consecutive World Championships, following gold in Lima 2023 and silver in Granada 2024.
Delubac’s silver marked France’s first-ever podium in Para Trap Worlds. Slovakia’s Filip Marinov, the reigning world champion from Granada, took bronze with 29 hits.
Hosts Czechia finished first in the PT1 team event (279 hits) with Italy in second (276). The PT2 team podium saw France in first place ahead of Italy by one shot (322 to 321). Czechia ended in third (271). The PT3 team gold went to Italy (315) with Spain in second (303).
Brno 2025 also introduced a demonstration mixed event for the first time at a Para Trap World Championships, with France taking top honours ahead of Italy 2 and the USA, respectively.
The 2025 WSPS Para Trap World Championships was organised by the Czech Disabled Shooting Association and Czech Paralympic Committee.

Cairo 2025: Athletes settle in ahead of Para Powerlifting showdown,"The Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships kick off in just a day’s time, beginning with the Rookie & Next Gen event on 9 and 10 October.
Athletes aged 20 or younger will compete across the two-day event for the first time ever, followed by the Elite World Championships, which will take place from 11 to 18 October.
The 11th edition of the World Para Powerlifting Championships is also the first to be held in Africa, while Egypt will be hosting its fourth major competition after the African Open Championships in 2022 and World Cups in 2023 and 2024.
The 10-day competition will be staged at the New Capital Sports Hall, a stunning venue located within the integrated Sports City in Egypt’s New Administrative Capital, east of Cairo.
With a capacity of 7,500, the hall is part of Egypt’s newest generation of sports facilities, originally built to host the 27th Men’s Handball World Championship (Egypt 2021).
Alongside eight bodyweight categories, the first day of competition will also feature the opening ceremony, scheduled for 18:30 (local time), just before the final two events — the women’s up to 50kg and 55kg categories.
Although the first two days are reserved for Rookie & Next Gen athletes, nearly all the Elite competitors have already arrived in Egypt’s capital and settled into the Tolip Hotel Olympic International City, located within the Egypt International Olympic City.
“Everything is very good and very well organised. I am very grateful,” said two-time World Championships medallist Herbert Aceituno, who noted there was still one area that could be improved:
“If I could have hot drinks — coffee and tea — at lunch and dinner, that would be great since many people like to have hot drinks on those occasions as well.”
The Brazilian contingent, the second largest in Cairo with 25 athletes, have arrived in full force, including Paralympic champion Tayana Medeiros, who has quickly settled in.
“Since my arrival, I’ve really enjoyed what I’ve seen — from the reception at the airport to the arrival at the hotel. It’s an incredible experience to reunite with friends I’ve made along the way and train alongside people I’ve seen competing. I’m looking forward to the start of the competition,” emphasised the 32-year-old from Rio.
The training venue is located within the hotel area, around a half-hour’s drive from the competition site. The slightly longer journey doesn’t seem to bother the athletes, who can enjoy seeing more of Cairo. However, Italian Paralympic medallist Donato Telesca has another concern.
“I like the hotel and climate a lot, but not the food, haha,” the 26-year-old said jokingly.
By contrast, everything seems to be going smoothly for Indonesia’s two-time Paralympic medallist Ni Nengah Widiasih.
“All good in the hotel and the training venue — the food and room are good as well,” said the athlete, who will be chasing her first World Championships medal since 2014.
Live results from all the Cairo 2025 action will be available on the link. All categories will also be live streamed via the Paralympic Games YouTube channel.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/cairo-2025-athletes-settle-ahead-para-powerlifting-showdown,paralympic.org,admin,
Cairo 2025: Broome ready to lift Team GB to new heights,"The Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships are just around the corner – first up is the Rookie & Next Gen event on 9 and 10 October, followed by the Elite World Championships from 11 to 18 October.
Preparations are in full swing for the biggest Para powerlifting showcase since the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games. This is the 11th edition of the WPPO Championships, set to make history as the first to be staged in Africa.
And there’s more at stake than medals: Cairo 2025 marks the very start of the qualification pathway towards the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympic Games.
One athlete with her eyes firmly set on LA is Olivia Broome. At just 24, the British Para powerlifter is already a two-time Paralympic bronze medallist. Now she’s kicking off her third Paralympic cycle with the clear goal of competing – and succeeding – in California.
But before the bright lights of LA, Broome has business to attend to in Cairo. This will be her fifth WPPO Championships since bursting onto the international scene at Mexico 2017 – the same year she first picked up Para powerlifting and instantly fell in love with the sport.
“I love the feeling of getting stronger and setting new personal bests both in and out of competition, and I love the opportunities it’s given me to compete all over the world,” Broome said in her British Weight Lifting athlete profile. “Training can be tough, but I love being in the gym with my teammates.”
Her progress was immediate. In 2018, she struck gold at the Berck-sur-Mer European Regional Championships in the junior category, lifting 80kg in the women’s up to 50kg class – a performance that also earned her fifth place in the senior competition.
The medals didn’t come right away on the world stage – she missed out at the 2019 World Championships in Nur-Sultan. But strong World Cup results secured her place at Tokyo 2020, where she made her Paralympic debut.
When it mattered most, Broome rose to the occasion. A second-round lift of 107kg earned her the bronze in the women’s up to 50kg category, behind China’s Dandan Hu and Egypt’s Rehab Ahmed, who both managed 120kg.
Just months later at the Tbilisi 2021 WPPO Championships, Broome struck again – twice. She lifted 107kg to reclaim her junior world title and then repeated the feat in the seniors to take silver, once again behind Rehab Ahmed.
In 2022, Broome moved up to the 55kg category and bagged another silver at the European Open in Georgia, lifting 115kg. But the following year she dropped back down to 50kg – and it paid off. At the Dubai 2023 World Para Powerlifting Championships, she delivered the performance of her life, lifting 112kg on her final attempt to win her first elite world title.
The celebrations were made even sweeter by the support of her Team GB squad. “We’re like a really close-knit family and it’s great that we all come and support each other. It’s a great group,” Broome said after her historic win.
That gold also guaranteed her a ticket to Paris 2024 – where she once again proved her class. Lifting 119kg, she secured another Paralympic bronze, matching the lift of China’s Jinping Xiao but just behind Venezuela’s Clara Sarahy Fuentes Monasterio, whose 124kg made history as her country’s first Para powerlifting medal.
Winning her second Paralympic medal in front of her whole family and plenty of friends made Paris extra special for Broome, especially after the empty stands and restrictions of a COVID-hit Tokyo 2020.
“It’s an extra drive because I wanted them to see this – to see what it’s like winning a medal.”
Now, with two Paralympic bronzes and a world title already to her name, Broome is heading to Cairo 2025 with plenty to defend – and even more to prove. At just 24, her third Paralympic cycle is only beginning, but the hunger is stronger than ever.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/cairo-2025-broome-ready-lift-team-gb-new-heights,paralympic.org,admin,
"Cairo 2025: China shine in team events, top medals as 11th edition concludes","China clinched gold medals in men’s and mixed team events and topped the medals standings as the Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships concluded after 10 days of thrilling action at the New Capital City Hall on Saturday (18 October).
This was the first time the World Championships were hosted in Egypt and in Africa. As many as 537 athletes from 70 nations, including all Paralympic champions from the Paris 2024 Games, competed in Cairo marking the beginning of the qualification pathway for the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympics.
Overall, in the Elite medals table, China finished on top with 13 medals that had eight gold medals followed by Nigeria and Iran with three and two gold medals, respectively. Hosts Egypt also shone on the podium twice in their overall five medals to sign off in fourth place.
After winning a close thrilling tie against Iraq in the head-to-head encounter, China men – comprising Paralympic medallists Yang Jinglang, Qi Yongkai and newcomer Zhang Pingkang - defeated Cuba 391.81- 140.48. Yongkai and Jinglang produced powerful lifts of 180 kh and 170 kg, respectively. For Cuba, only Pablo Ramirez Barrientos, the Paris 2024 Paralympic silver medallist, managed a successful lift of 181 kg in the first round.
An elated Qi Yongkai, who won bronze in the men's up to 59 kg individual event, said: “I like this game format because we play head-to-head. It’s more exciting since we don’t know the result until the very end. This win is for the team — I’m happy to be part of it, to work together, and to celebrate together.”
Pingkang, who impressed with a silver medal finish in his debut in men's up to 72 kg, said he felt the pressure. “I’m happy to have contributed to the team’s victory — winning gold after my individual silver. There was some pressure, as I didn’t want the team to lose because of me. The camaraderie within the Chinese team is truly amazing.”
In the mixed team final, Jinglang combined with Gu Xiaofei to put up a powerful show lifting 167 kg and 175 kg, respectively as China thrashed Uzbekistan by 367.76 – 104.07 points. Uzbekistan players managed just one successful lift out of three with Muslima Nuriddinova lifting 121 kg in second round. Egypt, comprising home favourite Rehab Ahmed, claimed their third bronze in the day, this time beating Brazil.
Brazil women’s team including reigning Paralympic champions Mariana D’Andrea and Tayana Madeiros made sure the team return home with a gold medal.
After settling for silver medals in their individual events, the Brazilian Paralympic stars came together to put up strong show and beat Uzbekistan by 312.94-214.03 points. Egypt took yet another bronze beating Indonesia.
Trailing 211.93-214.03 points after two rounds, Uzbekistan’s Rukhshona Uktamova faltered in the final lift of 125 kg only as Madeiros successfully lifted 127 kg to win the gold medal match. Earlier, D’Ándrea had lifted the heaviest weight in the women’s team finals – 135 kg in the opening round.
“I’m very happy. Last World Championships, it was very difficult for me with the loss of my father. I had to leave, and the team needed to put other girls to replace me and today we are here with the gold medal. I am happy to be part of this important moment for the team and like all the medals, this one is for my dad,” said an elated D’Ándrea as Madeiros and Lara joined her saying that it was an important moment for the team and they went all out to grab first gold medal for the team in the championships.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/cairo-2025-china-shine-team-events-top-medals-11th-edition-concludes,paralympic.org,admin,
Cairo 2025: Countdown begins to Africa’s first World Champs,"The Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships are just around the corner, with three weeks to go. The Rookie & Next Gen event will take place on 9 and 10 October, spanning two days for the first time ever.
The Elite Championships are scheduled from 11 to 18 October, with the final competition day reserved for team events. Cairo 2025 will be the 11th edition of the World Championships and the first to be held in Africa.
In total, 542 athletes from 71 National Paralympic Committees are set to take centre stage in Egypt at the Elite Championships, with the host nation leading the way with 34 athletes. Egypt is followed by Brazil (25), China (23) India (22), and Uzbekistan (22) in total entries.
With 20 bodyweight categories in the individual events, followed by three team events, athletes are almost evenly split by gender, with 314 men and 228 women competing in Cairo.
Once again, Egypt leads the way with 19 male athletes, but Brazil occupies the first place in female participation with 16 athletes. Egypt (15) and Nigeria (13) follow in the women's pool, while India (13) and Iran (12) occupy second and third place among the men.
There are 25 Neutral Para Athletes (NPA) registered, comprising 13 men and 12 women.
Most importantly, all Paris 2024 Paralympic Games gold medallists are confirmed for Cairo. The men’s categories remain unchanged, while the women’s competition has seen some movement.
Clara Fuentes Monasterio of Venezuela has moved up from the women’s up to 50kg to the up to 55kg category, while Egypt’s Rehab Ahmed will compete in the up to 61kg category.
Onyinyechi Mark of Nigeria has stepped up to the up to 67kg class, while China’s Tan Yujiao will contest in the up to 73kg category, where she will face two-time Paralympic champion Mariana D’Andrea of Brazil.
The Rookie & Next Gen event, taking place during the first two days, will feature 124 athletes from 28 National Paralympic Committees. Of these, 88 are men and 36 are women, with Uzbekistan leading the entries. The Asian nation is sending 26 athletes, followed by the host country with 21.

Cairo 2025: Donato Telesca steps up to a new challenge,"Donato Telesca of Italy is hungry for fresh challenges after claiming silver at the Dubai 2023 WPPO Championships and bronze at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games in the men’s up to 72kg category.
Now 26, Telesca is stepping into a new territory. He will compete in the men’s up to 88kg category at the upcoming Cairo 2025 WPPO Championships, which open on 9 October. For the first time, the Rookie & Next Gen event will span two days (9–10 October), before the Elite World Championships take centre stage from 11 to 18 October.
If all goes to plan, Telesca will contest his second World Championships medal on 12 October. After years of going head-to-head with two-time Paralympic champion Bonnie Bunyau Gustin, Telesca now enters a division led by China’s Panpan Yan, the reigning Paralympic champion from Paris. He will not be alone: Egypt’s Mohamed Elelfat and Ukraine’s Yurii Babynets, both medallists from Paris, are also in the mix.
For Elelfat, the home crowd will add an extra fire as he chases his first world title in more than a decade.
The men’s up to 88kg division is still searching for its new dominant force. Jordan’s Abdelkareem Khattab set the world record in Dubai before moving up to the 97kg category—where he promptly broke the record there as well. The absence of Khattab leaves the field wide open, and Telesca knows this could be his moment.
Born in Pietragalla and currently living in Rome, the Italian is beginning a new chapter after two of the finest years of his sporting life. He made history in Dubai as the first Italian to win a World Para Powerlifting Championships medal, before going one better in Paris by becoming the first from his nation to claim Paralympic silverware.
At the Port de la Chapelle Arena, watched by family and friends, Telesca lifted 213kg — just one kilogram short of silver, claimed by China’s Peng Hu. But the result mattered little to those who witnessed it. The celebration lasted long after the competition, filled with tears, embraces and unrestrained joy.
In that whirlwind of emotion, he told WPPO: “When I was going to the bench, I looked at them — my family, my friends — and thought: You can’t make any mistakes, you can’t do anything less than your best. This really matters, when you see every person who believes in you —my federation, my family, my coaches. My coach Antonio believed in me the most, together with my family. 
That medal was for them.”
The medal, however, carried an even deeper dedication. With teary eyes, Telesca added:
“My grandfather and my two grandmothers, who I’ve lost — this medal is for them. I was sad they couldn’t see me, but this medal belongs to them before anyone else.”
Now, more than a year since Paris, Telesca is refreshed and ready. A graduate in Economics and Management with a specialisation in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, he combines intellect with iron will.
Although still only 26, his journey already feels rich in history. He first discovered Para powerlifting in 2016 and made his international debut a year later at the Mexico City 2017 World Junior Championships, where he won gold.
He defended that title at the Nur-Sultan 2019 World Juniors and went on to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, finishing sixth. His rapid rise among the elite truly began in 2022, when he captured gold at the Tbilisi 2022 European Open Championships—launching the most successful period of his career so far.
Now Cairo awaits, and with it, a new weight class, a new field of rivals, and perhaps, a new place in history for Italy’s trailblazer.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/cairo-2025-donato-telesca-steps-new-challenge,paralympic.org,admin,
Cairo 2025: Egypt’s new generation set to shine,"The Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships are just a month away, starting on 9 October in Egypt’s capital. The competition will open with a two-day Rookie & Next Gen event, followed by the Elite World Championships from 11 to 18 October.
This will be the 11th edition of the world’s most prestigious gathering of Para powerlifters, but also a milestone for the sport. Cairo 2025 will mark the first time the World Championships have been held in Africa, and the first time the Rookie & Next Gen event being held over two days.
It will also be the largest Para powerlifting event ever staged in Egypt, which previously hosted the WPPO African Open Championships in Cairo in 2022 and two World Cup events – in Cairo in 2023 and Sharm El Sheikh in 2024.
Cairo 2025 will also serve as the launchpad for most athletes on their qualification pathway towards the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympic Games. Re-energised after Paris 2024 and focused on the next cycle, Egyptian para powerlifters will, especially, be motivated to build on their strong results last year.
Although Egypt won six medals in Paris – equalling their lowest tally in Paralympic powerlifting from Tokyo 2020 and Atlanta 1996 – the Games showed progress compared to Japan four years ago. In Paris, Egypt secured two golds, two silvers and two bronze medals, improving from Tokyo’s four silvers and two bronze medals.
More importantly, new stars emerged, signalling a bright future for the sport in Egypt.
One of those shining stars is 26-year-old Mohamed Elmenyawy, who won gold in Paris in the men’s up to 59kg category after lifting 201kg on his third attempt. He defeated reigning world and Paralympic champion Yongkai Qi of China and will be eager to repeat that feat on home soil in October.
Having previously won bronze at the Dubai 2023 World Championships, Elmenyawy will chase gold – and the perfect birthday gift – when he takes to the stage on 12 October, just two days after turning 27.
Another rising talent is Fatma Elyan, who has already proven on the international stage with consecutive silver medals. The 25-year-old lifted 122kg in the women’s up to 61kg category at Dubai 2023, then surpassed that result in Paris. Competing in a different class – the women’s up to 67kg – Elyan lifted 139kg, finishing just behind China’s Yujiao Tan at the last Paralympics.
Safaa Hassan is another Egyptian medallist from Paris. The 39-year-old lifted 139kg in her second attempt to secure bronze in the women’s up to 79kg category. Having finished fifth at the 2021 Tbilisi World Championships and seventh in Dubai two years later (in the 73kg class), her move up in weight category proved decisive, culminating in a breakthrough medal in Paris.
Egypt’s experienced names also shone. Rehab Ahmed finally claimed gold in the women’s up to 55kg category after two silvers, while Mohamed Elelfat and Nadia Ali both won their third Paralympic medals. Elelfat lifted 224kg in the men’s up to 88kg category to take silver, while Ali secured bronze in the women’s over 86kg with a 145kg lift – 16 years after her first Paralympic medal.
And Egypt still has another card to play. Sherif Osman, a three-time Paralympic champion, has battled injuries in recent years and fell short of expectations in Dubai 2023 and Paris 2024, finishing fifth and seventh in the men’s up to 59kg and 65kg categories. Fully fit, however, he remains one of the sport’s biggest names – and could be a decisive factor in front of a home crowd.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/cairo-2025-egypt-s-new-generation-set-shine,paralympic.org,admin,
Cairo 2025: Egypt’s powerlifting queen Rehab Ahmed overcomes injury to win fifth gold,"Four months after recovering from a chest injury (pectoralis major tears), Egyptian Powerlifting queen Rehab Ahmed clinched her fifth World Championships title on the fifth day of Elite competitions at Cairo 2025 on Wednesday (15 October).
And it’s a special one – her first one in a new weight category, women’s up to 61 kg category, and that too at home. The medal was her also first since her Paris 2024 gold medal show last August.
She already had three world titles – Mexico 2017, Nursultan 2019 and Tbilisi 2021 – in women’s up to 50 kg, one in women’s up to 55 kg in Dubai 2023.
Amid crowd cheering at the New Capital Sports City Hall, Ahmed started her journey at Cairo 2025 with a big 125 kg – four kilograms more than what fetched her the Paralympic gold in Paris in women’s – 55kg.
The two-time Paralympic silver medallist improved it to 131 kg in her second round, enough to take the gold medal. Meanwhile, Nigerians Ifeoluwa Alake (128 kg) and Franca Anigbogu (126 kg) displayed a show of power and courage to take the silver and bronze, respectively.
""I thank God for this gold medal. I am very happy today. Because during the Paris 2024, I suffered a chest injury while on the bench press – still I managed a gold medal but couldn’t have a good number. For nine months, I stayed at home and was recovering from the injury,"" said the 34-year-old Ahmed, who trained for just four months before the Worlds.
“Today, I made a strong comeback with a good number of 131 kg. In Los Angeles, I want to set a new world record.""
China made sure they continue to stay in the headlines as Cui Jianjin joined the ranks of their record setters Guo Lingling and Tan Yujiao.
Jianjin, who has three podium finishes in the World Championships since her debut in 2010, had waited for a long time for her first international gold medal and she nailed it in style.
Amid strong Chinese supporters, the Paris 2024 silver medallist broke the world record twice – first with a powerful 145 kg lift in her second attempt, before improving it with 147 kg en route clinching her first Worlds title in women’s up to 67kg.
Meanwhile, her arch-rival Onyinyechi Mark, the Paris 2024 Paralympic champion, stayed way behind of Jianjin going for 132 kg and 137 kg lifts to settle for silver. Paris 2024 silver Fatma Elyan was one kg behind Mark at 136 kg to take the bronze.
“I’m so happy because I am finally a world champion. I have had so many second and third places finish in the past. I’m very proud because I beat my biggest rival from Nigeria here,"" said an elated Jianjin after her victory and recording-breaking efforts.
“I feel calm and at peace because I trained for this result. I was prepared to break the world record during my training. I ‘m happy I could execute this accordingly.”
It was a sweet revenge for Turkiye’s Abdullah Kayapinar as he dethroned two-time Paralympic and world champion Omar Qarada for his first World Championship gold.
Kayapinar, the Paris 2024 silver medallist, lifted 179 kg in the third round to grab the gold in men’s 
up to 49 kg while Qarada settled for silver at 178 kg.
The fight for the top position began between Kayapinar and Qarada, whose campaigns were separated by three kilograms. The Turkish’s player faltered in the second round at 177 kg. But he came back in the third round while Qarada missed out at 180 kg.
The new Turkish star also attempted to break the long-standing world record of Vietnam’s Le Van Cong – set at 183.5 in Mexico 2017- but it wasn’t meant to be this time.
“After Paris 2024 Paralympics, I have been training very hard with my coach and I wished to break the world record here, but I couldn’t. I will try to break the record in future.
“I’m very excited to win my first world title in Cairo.”
Meanwhile, a disappointed Qarada said: “I have arrived in Cairo aiming at a new world record. But maybe not this time. It was a strong competition.”
Van Cong, the world record holder and Dubai 2023 champion, stayed on the heels of the leaders but settled for a fourth place at 176 kg.
Brazil’s Marco Tulio De Oliveira Cruz will return home from his debut World Championships without any complains. He made an impressive debut at the Worlds, getting all three clear lifts and the final one, 177 kg, fetching him the bronze.  

Live results from all the Cairo 2025 action are available on the World Para Powerlifting website. All categories will also be live streamed via the Paralympic Games YouTube channel.

Cairo 2025: Iran's Aminzadeh extends dominance with third world title,"It was another golden day for Iran as Ahmad Aminzadeh extended his dominance in the super-heavyweight category on the final day of individual competitions at the Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships on Friday (17 October).
Aminzadeh, the reigning Paralympic champion, clinched his third world title with a 260 kg lift in his second round and finished nine kilograms ahead of Gustavo Am Melo De Souza from Brazil in the men’s over 107 kg category.
The 34-year-old Iranian’s victory also ensured that the legacy of the late legend Siamand Rahman lives on in the super heavyweight category.
“After Paris 2024 Paralympics, I didn’t train much as I had some pain in my chest. But I’m happy that I won the gold here. I will go back Iran, work on my recovery and train harder,” said Aminzadeh who suffered an injury in Paris 2024.
“This is the first time I attempted to lift 270 kg, but it wasn’t meant to be here. I hope I can get it in the next competition.”
However, the fight was between Melo De Souza and Georgia’s Paris 2024 bronze medallist Akaki Jintcharadze for the second place as they stayed neck and neck in the second round, both lifting 247 kg.
The final round saw Melo De Souza finishing one kilogram ahead of Jintcharadze (250 kg). In the process, Melo De Souza improved his own Americas record from 236 kg to 251 kg while Jintcharadze broke the European record of 248 kg set at Tbilisi 2024.
“This is my first World Championships medal, and I worked very hard for this one. I wanted to take the silver, but the Brazilian went one better. The European record is special,” said Jintcharadze who won Georgia’s first ever Paralympic medal in the sport at Paris 2024.
China’s Zheng Feifei had to wait one year to settle the score with her old rival, Brazil’s reigning Paralympic champion Tayana Madeiros — and the result was sweet.
Feifei, the Dubai 2023 world champion, retained her title after a close contest with the Brazilian before the former succeeded with a second-round lift of 153 kg.
The big fight for the gold, in fact, began in the first round with the two champions starting at 147 kg before Feifei going ahead with 153 kg lift. Madeiros, meanwhile, faltered in the next two rounds.
Nigeria’s Ibeh Blessing managed 136 kg in her only successful second round attempt to take the bronze.
“I’m very happy to win the gold here. I competed with my old opponent (Brazil’s Tayana) again and happy to beat her. My strategy today was to lift at least kilogram more than my rival,” said Feifei, who holds the world record in the category at 159 kg set at Tbilisi 2024.
“I prepared for a year for this championship and aimed to break the world record here. There were a few mistakes, but I hope to improve in the next competition.”
Competitions in the individual events at Cairo 2025 ended on Friday (17 October) with the Team events - Men's Team, Women's Team and Mixed Team - to be competed on Saturday (18 October).

Live results from all the Cairo 2025 action are available on the World Para Powerlifting website. All categories will also be live streamed via the Paralympic Games YouTube channel.

Cairo 2025: Largest-ever Rookie & Next Gen World C’ships kick off,"The Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships got off to a spectacular start with the Rookie & Next Gen events as athletes showed power and intent of a bright future for the sport, at the New Capital Sports Hall on Thursday (9 October),
As many as 120 athletes (36 female and 84 male athletes), aged 20 or younger, are competing at Cairo 2025, making it the largest ever Rookie & Next Gen World Championships held for the first time over two days.
This will be followed by the Elite World Championships from 11 to 18 October.
The 11th edition of the World Championships marks a major milestone — this is the first time the event will take place not just in Egypt but in Africa. This is also one of the biggest championships hosted by Egypt after the African Open Championships in 2022 and World Cups in 2023 and 2024.
While many new faces shone on the opening day of the Cairo 2025, there were familiar faces too including Ecuador’s Paralympian Kerly Lascano who went on to achieve glory.
Lascano settled for 102 kg in her second attempt to clinch the women’s up to 41kg category gold and was proud about her efforts in Cairo.
“I was sad after a poor show in Paris. I trained hard and wanted to achieve the gold here. I’m very happy and excited,” said the 20-year-old Lascano, who also had a Next Gen silver from Dubai 2023.
Cairo will hold a special place for Hungary’s Gergo Szebenyi as he achieved his career best performance setting a new European and *world record in men’s up to 54kg class.
Szebenyi, the European champion (rookie), had three clear lifts with the final one, 149 kg, to break the European record before he went for a successful world record attempt with 152kg.
“It’s a great feeling to win the gold with a new world record. One month before the championships, I left a pain in my right shoulder, so I was cautious. But today, all my lifts were great. I was competing against myself today,” said the Hungarian who aims to be in the top 8 in the qualification pathway to Los Angeles 2028 Paralympics.
There were thrilling fights too.
In men’s up to 59kg, Armenian lifters Khoren Tsaturyan and Artur Babayan were engaged in a close battle for the gold with the former winning it by 1 kilogram. Tsaturyan took the gold with a powerful 142kg effort.
This was Tsaturyan’s second medal at the World Championships after his silver medal (rookie) in men’s -49kg category at Dubai 2023.
The 19-year-old, who is aiming to qualify for the Paralympics, said he had worked hard and believed in himself to achieve the result.
Seventeen-year-old Amalia Jimenez Gonzalez from Cuba set a new Americas and *world record on her way in winning the women’s -45kg event. After three successful lifts, Gonzalez showed strong determination and grit to attempt a successful powerlift of 90kg.
Uzbekistan powerhouse opened their account on the first day thanks to Khojiakbar Khomidov’s effort as he won his first Rookie & Next Gen World Championships medal.
The 19-year-old’s effort of 155kg also fetched Uzbekistan their first gold of the day in the men’s up to 65kg category.
Uzbek women added two more gold in the final event of the day - Zuhra Yudasheva won the women’s up to 55kg category with three clear lifts, the final a 90kg lift, while Ziyodakhon Bokijonova topped the podium in women's up to 50 kg.
Earlier, Kazakhstan’s Farkhat Mutunov claimed the first gold of the championships winning the men’s up to 49kg with a powerful lift of 141kg. It was the Kazakh’s second Rookie & Next Gen Worlds medal.
An opening ceremony, featuring athlete's parade and Egyptian cultural dance, officially opened the Cairo 2025 Worlds which was also attended by Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports Dr. Ashraf Sobhi.
The Rookie & Next Gen World Championships continues on Friday (10 October) with 11 events to be contested and live results available on the link.

Cairo 2025: Legend Sherif Osman eyes redemption at 1st Worlds at home,"Egyptian powerlifting great Sherif Osman marked his 43rd birthday on 15 September in the midst of preparations for the Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships.
The five-time world champion will take centre stage on 13 October in the men’s up to 65kg category – the category in which he has missed the podium at the past two major competitions.
This time, however, Osman is determined to rewrite the script. Cairo 2025 will not only be his chance to compete on home soil, but also the first World Championships ever to be staged in Africa. The Egyptian capital will host the Rookie & Next Gen event on 9 and 10 October, followed by the Elite World Championships from 11 to 18 October.
For Osman, Cairo 2025 will be his eighth World Championships appearance. Five of his previous seven campaigns ended with gold, with only his debut in Kuala Lumpur 2010 and his most recent outing in Dubai 2023 finishing without a medal.
While 2010 was part of his learning curve, the disappointment of Dubai was harder to bear: an injury, which had troubled him for three years, ultimately derailed his medal hopes and hampered his build-up to the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.
“Now I’m starting to increase my numbers (of kilograms lifted), but time is the biggest problem that all people face,” Osman reflected after placing seventh in the men’s up to 65kg at Paris 2024.
His dip in form began at the Cairo 2022 African Open Championships, where he finished fourth in the men’s up to 59kg class. Compatriot Mohamed Elmenyawy claimed gold that day and went on to claim the bronze at Dubai 2023 and then a Paralympic title in Paris. Osman, meanwhile, finished 10th in Dubai before moving up to the 65kg division for Paris 2024.
Now fit and focused, Osman is relishing the chance of contesting another major championship on home ground. When injury-free, he has long been regarded as one of the dominant forces in Para powerlifting.
Over the past two decades, the athlete from Beni Mazar has amassed an extraordinary record: four Paralympic medals – three golds and one silver – alongside five world titles.
His rise has been meteoric. Just two years after taking up Para powerlifting, Osman struck gold at the Beijing 2008 Paralympics in the men’s up to 56kg class.
“I love my sport because my sport has changed my life,” he said in the build-up to Paris 2024. “Now my career is 18 years long. I started in 2006. I have taken part in four Paralympic Games and the aim of sport is not about winning. This sport I love, powerlifting, is about competing – and I will keep competing.”
Osman’s golden era began at London 2012 and stretched to Tokyo 2020, a nine-year spell in which he became the undisputed powerhouse of the men’s up to 59kg division. During that time he captured three world titles and two further Paralympic golds, while also competing at lower categories in London 2012 (56kg) and the Dubai 2014 Worlds (54kg).
He also etched his name into the record books. At Dubai 2014 he lifted 205kg in the men’s up to 54kg – a world record that still stands. Two years later, at Rio 2016, he raised the bar again with 211kg in the men’s up to 59kg, another record yet to be surpassed.
Only two other Para powerlifters currently hold active world records in multiple categories: China’s Lingling Guo (women’s up to 41kg and 45kg) and Jordan’s Abdelkareem Khattab (men’s up to 88kg and 97kg), both Paralympic champions at Paris 2024.
Osman’s dominance was finally broken at Tokyo 2020, where he aimed for a fourth consecutive Paralympic crown but lost out to China’s Yongkai Qi. Both lifted 187kg, but Qi took the title on lighter body weight by just 0.66kg.
“That time in Tokyo I felt that I had more power and higher numbers in me, but I couldn’t do it because two months before the Games I had got injured,” Osman later reflected.
Despite the setback, he ended 2021 on a high, securing gold at the Tbilisi 2021 WPPO Championships – his most recent major title.
As Cairo 2025 approaches, Osman insists that his ambitions are far from over. Rather than a swansong, he perceives the home World Championships as the launchpad for another Paralympic cycle.
“I will be back. Los Angeles (2028) is waiting for me,” he declared.
Beyond his own career, Osman is already preparing for life after competition. He serves as Chair of the WPPO Athletes’ Committee, elected multiple times by his peers, and envisions a future in coaching – guiding the next generation of lifters with the same passion that has defined his extraordinary journey.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/cairo-2025-legend-sherif-osman-eyes-redemption-1st-worlds-home,paralympic.org,admin,
Cairo 2025: Nigeria’s Ferdinard surprises Paralympic champion Han on thrilling day 1,"Thrilling contests marked the opening day of the Elite competitions at the Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships on Thursday (11 October) even as Paralympic stars returned to achieve glory one year since their Paris 2024 feats.
The Cairo 2025 Worlds also marked the beginning of the qualification pathway for the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympics and thus the three categories contested on the day lived up to the expectations.
A total of 70 National Paralympic Committees is being represented by 537 athletes — 311 men and 226 women in Cairo, first time the event is being held in Africa.
Much like the day started with exciting contest of the men’s up to 80 kg category, the final competition of the day was equally exhilarating.
In fact, it surprised everyone as Nigeria’s debutant Rita Ferdinard came from nowhere to clinch the women’s up to 79 kg gold.
Ferdinard made a dream debut to her international journey beating the reigning Paralympic champion Miaoyu Han of China in a show power and courage at the New Capital Sports Hall in Cairo.
Starting with an impressive 142 kg lift in her first-ever appearance in an international competition, Ferdinard added six more kilos in her second attempt which was enough to take the gold.
Meanwhile, Han chose to attempt lighter weights – she had all clear lifts with the final one at 143 kg, which meant the Nigerian already was confirmed as the world champion before her third attempt.
The 30-year-old athlete from Oyo state in Nigeria, however, went for 153 kg and broke the African record – one kilogram less than the standing world record of the Han set at Paris 2024.
Jordan’s Asma Issa settled for the bronze on 136 kg and claimed her first medal at a World Championships.
“I was super happy and excited. It was my first World Championship, and I managed to win the gold.”
“I trained for two months to compete in this championship. I hope to get a world record in the next championships,” said Ferdinard, who was the gold medallist at Nigeria’s National Sports Festival last year.
It has been a while since Venezuelan Clara Fuentes Monasterio won her Paralympic gold in Paris. And she made sure that she wins it again at the right place – and it was right here at Cairo 2025.
Monasterio, the 28-year-old from Caracus, clinched her first Worlds title in a thrilling women’s up to 50 kg contest after lifting 121 kg in her second attempt. She has had a silver medal back at Tbilisi 2021 Worlds in women’s up to 41 kg.
Monasterio was challenged by Nigerian Esther Nworgu with both starting at 118kg, before the Venezuelan went ahead with her second attempt of 121 kg.
Nworgu, the silver medallist at Paris 2024 and Dubai 2023 Worlds in women’s up to 41 kg, succeeded in her second attempt of 120 kg and was unsuccessful in her lift of 125 kg. This made Clara the champion.
Clara too failed in her third attempt but that didn’t affect the result. In the end, the golden colour of her medal matched the colour of her nail polish.
""I'm still recovering from the 125g lift - it was a tough one. But I'm happy and excited to get my first World Championships title. Cairo is special as today I competed my dream of being a Paralympic and world champion.""
""After Paris, I took a long break - I got married and spent time with my family. I trained for two months before this championship. There was a lot of emotion today - I also felt a bit pressure as my Nigerian opponent was challenging me. But I enjoyed it,"" said the Santiago 2023 Parapan American champion.
Another strong athlete from Nigeria, Rukayat Ajiboye settled for the bronze.
Earlier, China’s Xiaofei Gu returned to the top of podium of a World Championships since Tbilisi 2021 displaying a confident show to take the gold in men’s up to 80 kg.
With the reigning Paralympic and world champion Roohallah Rostami moving up to men's up to 88 kg category, the field was wide open and four-time Paralympic silver medallist Gu grabbed the opportunity.
The fight was on between Gu and Uzbekistan’s Bekzod Jamilov, the bronze medallist at Dubai 2023 Worlds and Hangzhou 2022 Asian Para Games in men’s up to 72 kg.
With one kilogram separating the two strong lifters after the second attempt, the Chinese went for his third successful attempt at 223. The Uzbek athlete settled with 222. Iraq’s Rasool Mohsin stayed on the heels of the leaders with a powerful show only to settle on 221 kg and took the bronze.
Refugee Paralympic Team athlete Hadi Darvish finished on eighth place but achieved his career best entering the 200-mark. South Korea’s Gyuho Kim, aiming for his first medal at a global competition, settled for the fourth place on 205 kg.
“We do a lot of training with the coach. And this helped me maintain my form since Paris 2024,” said Gu on winning the Worlds title once year after Paralympics.
“It’s a pity that I couldn’t compete against him (Roohalah Rostami). Hope I get to compete against him in the next championships,” he added on missing the chance to compete against the Irian star.
Live results from all the Cairo 2025 action are available on the World Para Powerlifting website. All categories will also be live streamed via the Paralympic Games YouTube channel.
The Elite competition continues until 18 October with three events lined up for Sunday (12 October) with athletes competing in men’s up to 88 kg, men’s up to 59 kg and women’s up to 55 kg weight categories.

Cairo 2025: Oluwafemiayo on a mission for more glory,"Nigeria's Folashade Oluwafemiayo is preparing for her fifth World Championships appearance, aiming to win her fifth medal.
The 40-year-old will compete on 16 October in the women’s over 86kg category – the same class in which she won gold at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.
The 11th edition of the World Para Powerlifting Championships take place from 9 to 18 October, and for the first time will be hosted in Africa. Cairo will stage the Rookie & Next Gen event from 9 to 10 October before the Elite World Championships run for eight consecutive days.
Oluwafemiayo, who took up para powerlifting in 2010, burst onto the scene with a silver medal at the London 2012 Paralympics in the women’s -75kg category – all while pregnant.
Her progress was halted in 2013 when she tested positive for the banned substance furosemide and was suspended for two years. She returned, only to press pause again before the Rio 2016 Games, this time due to pregnancy.
The then 32-year-old came back stronger, winning gold at the Mexico City 2017 World Championships with a world record lift and successfully defending her title two years later at Nur-Sultan 2019.
COVID-19 only delayed what seemed inevitable – her first Paralympic gold. At Tokyo 2020 she dominated the women’s up to 86kg, lifting 151kg to finish 12kg clear of China’s Feifei Zheng. By the end of that cycle, she had two world titles and a Paralympic crown to her name.
While many might have eased off, Oluwafemiayo kept building. Just four months after Tokyo she won gold at the Tbilisi 2021 World Para Powerlifting Championships and followed up with another first place at the Cairo 2022 African Open Championships.
But in Dubai 2023 came a rare setback. Despite lifting 152kg, she had to settle for bronze behind Zheng and Ukraine’s Nataliia Oliinyk, who produced record-breaking lifts. Zheng broke the world record with 158kg, while Oliinyk secured silver with a European record of 153kg.
That disappointment fuelled change. Switching to the women’s over 86kg just in time for Paris 2024, Oluwafemiayo struck gold again – this time with a world record 167kg lift.
That mark still stands. In Cairo, she will attempt to raise it once more, facing the challenge of home favourite Nadia Ali, bronze medallist in Paris.
""Paris 2024 won’t be my last Paralympic Games. I’m still training for more and I’m targeting more world records,” Oluwafemiayo told BBC Sport Africa before Paris.
Once dreaming of becoming a nurse, she is now one of the world’s greatest para powerlifters.
“What an able-bodied person can do, I can do too. I want to make Africa proud, Nigeria proud, myself, my family and my federation,” she said.
Now, in Cairo, she will aim to do just that – and write another golden chapter in her remarkable career.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/cairo-2025-oluwafemiayo-mission-more-glory,paralympic.org,admin,
"Cairo 2025: Paris 2024 champions Gharibshahi, Oluwafemiayo shatter world records","Iran’s Aliakbar Gharibshahi arrived in Cairo with a clear purpose — and he proved it with a dominant, record-breaking performance to capture his third World Championships title at the New Capital City Hall on Thursday (16 October).
Gharibshahi, the two-time world champion, displayed an incredible show of strength and determination to break his own world record of 254 kg (set in Dubai 2022) by one kilogram in the second round of men’s up to 107 kg final. He attempted to go further with 260 kg only to falter this time and save it for later.
“After Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, I trained a lot to set to raise the bar again. I came to Cairo 2025 with a new world record in my mind and wanted to set 260 kg but maybe next time,” said the 43-year-old Gharibshahi, who won the gold at Paris 2024 with a Paralympic record lift of 252 kg one year ago.
Tokyo 2020 champion Sodnompiljee Enkhbayar settled for the silver at 243 kg.
It was a special day for USA’s Bobby Body, the 2023 Parapan American Games champion, as he embarked into the pathway of LA 2028 with his first ever World Championship medal – the bronze medal. In the process, he also broke the Parapan Am Games record with an effort of 237 kg in the second round.
Nigeria have had a great campaign at Cairo 2025 and Folashad Oluwafemiayo made sure it continues as she regained her World Championship title after four years.
Oluwafemiayo, the two-time Paralympic and three-time champion, was amazing on the bench as she convincingly improved her own world record at 168 kg. The 40-year-old held the world record from Paris 2024 when she took the gold with an effort of 167 kg one year ago in women's over 86kg.
Starting her campaign in Cairo at 155 kg, she gradually improved to 160 kg, 165 kg and then the big lift. But it seemed easy for the Nigerian as she raised the bar yet gain.
China's Zhu Wenjun (157 kg) took the silver ahead of Iran's Rozbahani Nikoo (152 kg).
""I feel on top of the world. I feel great and happy to be able to use my strength.
After Paris 2024, I rested well and resumed my training, and I trained hard for five months before coming here. I will keep on training and improving to make my country and my family proud,"" said the Paris 2024 gold medalist Oluwafemiayo.
""The secret is prayers, support from family and friends, and Kasaba,"" she joked when asked about the secret behind the strength and power of Nigeria players.
Earlier, two-time Paralympic champion Abdelkareem Khattab from Jordan pushed through pain to clinch his third world title at Cairo 2025.
Khattab lifted an impressive 240 kg in his first round, enough to take the gold way ahead of Egyptian Hany Abdelhady (229 kg) and Iran's Aliasghar Abareghi (227 kg).
Khattab, the three-time world champion, though wanted to finish his campaign with some bigger numbers on the weights, as he went for 250 kg and then 271 kg but was unsuccessful - the Jordanian holds the world record at 270 kg set at Paralympic Games in Paris last summer.
""It feels great to raise the flag of my country again. I tried to break the world record but no luck. But I will regain my strength and comeback stronger,"" said the 34-year-old Khattab who admitted feeling some pain on his chest - he suffered an injury during training in Jordan two months back.

"Cairo 2025: Powerlifting greats Yujiao, Gustin rise to new challenges","A new weight category might be a challenge for many other athletes but not for China’s three-time Paralympic champion Tan Yujiao, who smashed the four-year-old Asian record in her very first attempt on the third day of Elite competitions at the Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships on Monday (13 October).
Yujiao, who already had four world titles in women’s up to 67 kg, pushed herself to a new limit lifting 147 kg and stunned reigning Paralympic champion in the category Mariana D’Ándrea for the gold medal in the women’s up to 73 kg final. The Paris 2024 and Tokyo 2020 champion from Brazil settled on 141 kg - seven kilograms lesser than what she lifted in Paris 2024.
With one kilogram separating the top two leaders, it was expected to be a close fight for the gold, but the winner emerged after Yujiao’s second successful lift of 147 kg. Meanwhile, D’Ándrea couldn’t succeed in the next two rounds.
In the process, the Chinese also broke the Asian record of China’s Xu Lili on 138 kg set at Tbilisi 2021 Worlds.
Another big name, Lucy Ejike, the three-time Paralympic and world champion, was expected to be in the medal contention but finished in fifth place.
“I don’t know what to say. I won the gold medal, but I felt I didn’t do my best. In the plan, I wanted to touch the world record. I need to work harder,” said the 35-year-old Chinese legend who faltered in the final attempt at the New Capital Sport City Hall.
“I have been playing in the women’s up to 67 kg category for long time and every competition I had to lose my body weight. After Paris 2024, I thought if I need to grow and become powerful, I should move to this new category.”
Yujiao, however, admitted she was a bit 'nervous' before the competition. “Because in this category, we have very good opponents. Mariana and Ejike are very strong,”
“I wanted to touch my new limit. In future, I want to see a stronger Tan Yujiao,” she added.
For the past several years, the men’s up to 72kg category has been thoroughly dominated by three-time world champion and world record holder Bonnie Bunyau Gustin, who has consistently lifted far above his rivals.
However, his dominance was tested at the Cairo 2025 Worlds with Chinese newcomer Zhang Pingkang giving tense moments by opening the finals with a lift six kilograms heavier than Gustin.
The 26-year-old Gustin began his campaign with 216 kg, while 22-year-old Zhang started off with a successful 222 kg lift. But the inexperienced Chinese faltered in the next two lifts settling for second place.
The Malaysian great, meanwhile, calmly increased his lifts with successful attempts at 226 kg and then 230 kg. Just two kilograms shy of his world record mark of 232 kg, a new world record attempt at 233 kg in the Powerlift was an obvious choice but Gustin faltered. Great Britain’s Mark Swan, the Paris 2024 silver medallist, claimed the bronze at 217 kg.
He later admitted: “Yes, I was nervous. This was the first time I saw the athlete from China who started straight with 222 kg, and I began with 216 kg.”
“But I am very satisfied with my performance today.”
China continued to field new names at these World Championships as Zhou Shiwei came out of nowhere to win his first international title at Cairo.
Zhou, the 21-year-old who trained for nine years for a dream debut, lifted 205 kg in his only successful second attempt enough to take the men's up to 65 kg gold. Iran’s Mohsen Bakhtiar, the Paris 2024 bronze medallist in men’s up to 59 kg, settled for silver on 201 kg ahead of Algeria’s Hoccine Bettir, the Tbilisi 2021 world champion, who managed 192 kg.
“I was nervous before my first lift, but I was lucky to have my coach always beside me,” said the rising star from China.
“This gold was a milestone for me as this was my first international medal – this gave me a lot of confidence; and I look forward to break the world record in future.”
Surprisingly, the reigning Paralympic champion and world recordholder Zou Yi finished way below in ninth place with a lesser lift of 180 kg – Zou won the Paris 2024 gold with 215 kg.
Egyptian legend Sherif Osman finishes 15th at his seventh Worlds with a 163kg lift and kept his Paralympic dreams alive.
“I feel I am on my way to Los Angeles 2028. I’m proud of my show today as I trained for just four weeks. I didn’t compete for gold or silver here – but to keep my participation on the pathway to LA 2028,” said 43-year-old legend who has three Paralympic gold.
Live results from all the Cairo 2025 action are available on the World Para Powerlifting website. All categories will also be live streamed via the Paralympic Games YouTube channel.
The Elite competition continues until 18 October with three events lined up for Tuesday (14 October) with athletes competing in men’s up to 54 kg, women’s up to 45 kg and women’s up to 41 kg weight categories.

Cairo 2025: Reigning Paralympic champion Elmenyawy strikes first gold for Egypt,"There was emotion, there was pressure and there was glory in the end!
Reigning Paralympic champion Mohamed Elmenyawy delivered it when it mattered the most – winning his first World Championships title at home, in front of his family and friends on the second day of the Elite competitions at Cairo 2025 on Sunday (12 October).
The 27-year-old home star returned to international stage one year after his incredible gold medal at Paris 2024 only to achieve his career-best 210 kg in the men’s up to 59 kg at home.
Starting with 204 kg, three kilograms more than his Paris 2024 campaign, Elmenyawy went higher with successful lifts of 207 kg and 210 kg as his sisters and his father watched him in awe.
“I’m over the moon!""
""This gold medal was very important for me, to win it in my home country as my family and friends watched me live competing for the first time. There were intense emotions, but I believed in my dream, in my training and the Almighty,” said the Dubai 2023 bronze medallist who patiently obliged his fans with photographs at the New Capital Sports Hall in Cairo.
The local star, however, attempted to break the long-standing world record of his idol Sherif Osman on 212 kg set at the Rio2016 Paralympics, and nearly came close to it.
“It was my dream to break the world record of Sherif (Osman) but Inshallah (God willing), next time,” he said adding:
“I will go step by step,” said 2022 African champion who bowed on the mat to thank the Almighty for his achievement.
The men’s up to 88 kg final was about battle of Paralympic champions.
Paris 2024 champion in men’s up to 80 kg, Roohallah Rostami of Iran has moved to this new category, and the reigning Paralympic champion Yan Panpan faced him for the first time.
There were also a few others waiting to challenge the Paralympic stars including home lifter Mohamed Elelfat who wanted to put up a good show at home.
And it was an exciting contest.
The Paris 2024 silver medallist Mohamed Elelfat’s last medal in Worlds was four years back at Tbilisi 2021 in men’s up to 80 kg and he made sure he wins it again at his home championships. He lifted a 227 kg to take the bronze medal.
China's Ye Jixiong, the 2017 and 2019 world champion, also stayed in the medal contention only to finish in fourth place on 226 kg.
But the fight for the gold was between Rostami and Panpan, with both starting with a heavy 235 kg in first attempt.
The Chinese failed the second attempt while Iranian made a successful lift of 243 kg.
The fate turned around in the third round as Panpan successfully lifted 244 kg while Rostami missed it to settle for second place. This is Panpan’s first world title in the category – he won the gold in men’s up to 97 kg in Dubai 2023.
“I was little bit nervous as there were new players in the category. I haven’t faced the Iranian before, but my coach comforted me and I focused on just my game,” said the 35-year-old Chinese.
“After the second and third lift, I still thought that Rostami will win it. So, the win came as a big surprise.”
Italian Donato Telesca, the Paris 2024 bronze medallist and Dubai 2023 Worlds silver medallist in men’s up to 72 kg, put up a strong show but wasn’t still enough as he settled for fifth place with a lift of 222 kg.
Nigeria claimed their second gold in as many days as Rio 2016 silver medallist Esther Oyema returned to winning ways in a World Championships since Dubai 2015 ending a 11-year wait.
Oyema, the 43-year-old, put up a clinical show with three clear lifts with the final one 125 kg fetching her the long-awaited gold. Paris 2024 silver medallist Besra Duman of Turkiye stayed close on the heels of the leader finishing on 121 kg for the second place, just one kilogram ahead of Russia’s Tamara Podpalnaia.
“I’m so happy – it is not easy to come back and win a medal. The secret behind this medal is my coach as she knows the technicalities, she knows my strength, what I can do,” said the Nigerian in jubilation.
“I want to break the world record – it is just the beginning.”
Great Britain’s Olivia Broome, the Dubai 2023 world champion in women’s up to 50 kg. managed a fourth-place finish after moving her category.

Cairo 2025: Rookie & Next Gen stars ready to lift history,"The historic Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships are now just three days away, and anticipation is building fast. The Rookie & Next Gen event will open the action on 9 and 10 October, followed by the Elite World Championships from 10 to 18 October.
The 11th edition of the World Championships marks a major milestone — the first time the event will take place in Africa, and the first to host the Rookie & Next Gen competition across two full days.
The competition begins on Thursday, 9 October, at 09:30am (local time), with eight bodyweight categories kicking off the event. The second day promises to be even busier, starting at 09:00am, and featuring 11 different categories.
Compared to the Dubai 2023 Rookie & Next Gen World Championships, Cairo 2025 will witness a remarkable 107 per cent increase in athlete participation. The number has soared from 58 competitors in 2023 to 120 this year — a clear sign of the sport’s rapid growth.
In total, 36 female athletes and 84 male athletes will take to the stage in Cairo, all chasing medals and international recognition.
Uzbekistan leads the entries with 26 athletes, followed by Egypt with 21, while Armenia and Iran share third place with eight athletes each. Uzbekistan also boasts the highest number of both male and female competitors (15 and 11 respectively), while Egypt matches the Asian powerhouse in male representation with 15 lifters.
Cairo will also be a stage for the next generation of Para powerlifting talent, with several promising athletes set to make their mark between 9 and 10 October.
Among them, Kerly Lascano of Ecuador will compete in the women’s up to 41kg category on 9 October, while Rukhshona Uktamova of Uzbekistan will take part a day later in the women’s up to 67kg class.
Both athletes made their Paralympic debuts at the Paris 2024 Games, where Uktamova impressed with a fifth-place finish in the women’s up to 61kg category, lifting 114kg. The Uzbek talent is also the reigning Rookie champion from Dubai, while Lascano claimed silver in the Next Gen event behind Brazil’s Lara Aparecida de Lima.
The now 22-year-old Brazilian was the only Rookie or Next Gen athlete to capture a medal in the Elite competition at Dubai 2023, earning bronze in the women’s up to 41kg category.
Both Lascano and Uktamova will be looking to follow in her footsteps, with Uktamova bringing valuable experience from Dubai, where she finished 12th in the women’s up to 55kg category.
Live results from all the Cairo 2025 action will be available on the link.

Cairo 2025: Tan Yujiao ready to embrace new challenges,"With three Paralympic gold medals and multiple world records, Tan Yujiao has redefined strength and courage over the past decade. Her resilience and relentless drive to improve herself have been the hallmark of her performances.
The Chinese powerlifting star, already a four-time world champion, now turns her focus to the Cairo 2025 World Championships, arriving with renewed determination and as one of the top favourites.
The Championships – the first Worlds to take place in Egypt and Africa – will be her second event since her record-breaking show at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games – Yujiao improved her own world record with a 142kg powerlift amid to thunderous cheers at La Chapelle Arena in Paris.
This time, however, the ever-smiling lifter will take on a fresh challenge — competing in a new weight category, the women’s up to 73kg division.
“Every competition is a new challenge. Even though I've already won four World Championships, I'm still looking forward to achieving new heights. I know there are some excellent and respectable new opponents in this weight class (women’s up to 73kg), but my form has also improved since I gained weight, so I'm really looking forward to competing against them,” Yujao said ahead of the competition.
While the Chinese Para powerlifting icon expressed her excitement about competing in an African nation for the first time, she also highlighted the hard work and preparation she has put in for the Championships.
“I've been training very hard — specific training, conditioning, muscle strength, and technique. I've tried to maintain a consistent sleep and rest schedule to keep myself in my top physical condition,” said Yujiao, who began powerlifting at the age of 12.
For someone who has been undefeated at a major international competition since her debut at the London 2012 Paralympic Games, where she took the silver, the 34-year-old lifter continues to push herself to excel in every event.
She did it in Paris 2024 recently and aims to continue with that momentum in Cairo where she faces a new challenge - top stars in the women’s -73kg category including Paris 2024 gold medallist Brazilian Mariana D'Andrea and Nigeria’s Kafila Almaruf, the reigning world champion and world record holder in the category at 151kg.
D’Andrea, a two-time Paralympic champion, won her first world title at Dubai 2023 –bettering her own world record by five kilograms before winning the women’s up to 79 kg gold. She had been a silver medallist in the women’s -73kg and will be eager to improve the colour of her medal this time around.
Yujiao, however, is approaching her sixth World Championships with confidence.
“I had injuries in the past, but this [Paris] gold medal is proof to the world that I still can do it,"" she had said after winning her third Paralympic gold.
“It was an unforgettable and thrilling moment. Not only did I showcase my abilities to the world and bring honour to my country, but I also achieved a perfect milestone in my life. That shining moment was truly amazing! These achievements also inspire me to continue moving forward on my sports path and explore more possibilities!”
The Paris 2024 Games were memorable for more than just her gold-medal triumph. They also marked a turning point in her career beyond the field of play.
On the very same day she stood atop the podium, Yujiao was elected to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) Athletes’ Council and also began serving as the IPC’s representative on the WADA Athletes’ Council.
“This marked the beginning of my journey as an athlete representative,” she reflected.
“Travelling to Germany to the IPC headquarters and to Switzerland for meetings, I learned about the Paralympic Movement’s vision, the latest developments in our sport, the work of the global anti-doping community, and most importantly, how to truly represent athletes.”
Now, with her usual humility and determination, the Chinese powerlifting star understands the responsibility that comes with her new role. Her goal is simple — to keep improving, keep learning, and to truly be a voice for athletes around the world.
“I have a vast community of Paralympic athletes behind me, which gives me a great sense of responsibility. I need to continuously learn and hone my skills to better listen to the voices of the athletes. This year, I also enrolled in a master's program at Shanghai University of Sport, where I hope to continue to improve myself. Overall, the year since the Paris Paralympic Games has been busy, fulfilling, and exciting.”
Looking ahead to the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympic Games, Yujiao also shared her plans and preparations as she aims to compete in her fifth Paralympic Games.
She feels in strong shape and is determined to follow in the footsteps of her coach, Zhang Haidong, by aiming for four consecutive Paralympic gold medals. “
“Of course, I know it won't be easy – it will be a challenging journey, but I will do my best.
“The most radiant crown always belongs to the one who works the hardest, is the strongest, the most powerful, and the most fortunate. I hope I'll be that person,” she hoped.
But before that, her focus is firmly set on Cairo.
“This will be a tough competition, but I will give my best and aim to break the world record at this new level,” she concluded.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/cairo-2025-tan-yujiao-ready-embrace-new-challenges,paralympic.org,admin,
Cairo 2025: ‘Unstoppable’ Guo Lingling raises the bar with new world record,"It was all about China’s Guo Lingling and her remarkable tradition of breaking world records in major events – her seventh consecutive - on the fourth day of the Elite competitions at the Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships on Tuesday (14 October).
Lingling, the two-time Paralympic champion, claimed her fifth world championships title in her usual way – bettering her own world record of 124 kg by one kilogram on her way to winning the women’s up to 45 kg crown at the New Capital Sports City Hall.
This was also the first world record of the World Championships, held for the first time in Africa.
The 36-year-old strong Chinese had three clear lifts 120, 123 and 125 kg, with the final lift smashing her own world record set in Beijing 2025 World Cup in June. In fact, her second lift was already an indication what’s on the cards.
Newcomer Tolulope Ogundolie of Nigeria settled for second place after putting up an remarkable show on her debut. She had all three successful lifts at 108, 110 and 112 kg, Uzbekistan's Nasiba Tashpulatova, the bronze medallist at Bejing 2025 World Cup, picked up her first worlds medal.
“I feel very honoured and happy that I broke the world record once again. I managed to improve my results and go up another level. The most important thing is training and keep competing – which helps me to get accustomed to challenging situations,” said Lingling, who also had two Asian Para Games titles including the gold in Hangzhou 2022 where she set the women’s up to 41 kg world record at 123 kg.
Lingling's incredible show was followed by a clinical performance by another Chinese star Cui Zhe, who also had three successful lifts to clinch the women’s up to 41kg gold.
Zhe, who already had four gold medals at the world championships, looked comfortable on the bar as she calmly raised it from 110 kg to 117 kg – two kilograms less than what she lifted at Paris 2024 for a new Paralympic record.
""This is my fifth World Championships title and I'm very excited this time. Because the competition level has improved a lot and I made sure that I have not fallen behind. I want to compete in more world championships and get a good result at the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympics,"" said the 38-year-old Zhe, who also has four Asian Para Games gold.
Ecuador’s Kerly Lascano, who earlier won the Next Gen world title in Cairo, was impressive on the bar too as she clinched her first senior World Championship medal with 110 kg.
“I’m very excited. I was fighting for the podium – but more than that I am still in shock that I have beaten one of my rivals,” said the 20-year-old already setting her sights on a medal at LA 2028.
Paris 2024 bronze medallist Lara Aparecida De Lima managed the bronze with 107 kg.
Kazakhstan’s Paris 2024 champion David Degtyarev extended his dominance in the men’s up to 54 kg event winning his third World Championship title in style. He smashed his own Asian record – set at Hangzhou 2022 Asian Para Games at 186 kg – three times to settle at 191 kg in his final lift.
El Salvador’s Herbert Aceituno, the Tbilisi 2021 and Dubai 2023 silver medallist in men’s up to 59 kg, was amazing on his first campaign in the new category.
He put up a strong fight starting one kilogram behind Degtyarev at 186 kg and stayed on the heels of the Kazakh throughout. The two-time Parapan American Games champion finally ended on 190 kg for the silver, again.
Paris 2024 bronze meadllist Yang Jinglang also finished with a strong final lift of 186 kg.
“Today I competed against great rivals – a new rival from El Salvador has contested in my category. He is a great guy. It was an interesting battle, very close one and I enjoyed it. I’m very happy – Thank you to my coach, my friends and my wife who had supported me always. This is a victory for entire Kazakhstan,” said the 29-year-old Aceituno.
Live results from all the Cairo 2025 action are available on the World Para Powerlifting website. All categories will also be live streamed via the Paralympic Games YouTube channel.
The Elite competition continues until 18 October with three events lined up for Wednesday (15 October) with athletes competing in women’s up to 61 kg, men’s up to 49 kg and women’s up to 67 kg weight categories.

Cairo 2025: Ones to watch!,"Cairo, Egypt, is ready to host the 11th edition of the World Para Powerlifting Championships from 9 to 18 October.
It will be the first-ever World Championships to take place in Africa and the first in which the Rookie & Next Gen event will run over two competition days (9–10 October).
The Elite World Championships will follow from 11 to 18 October, with 533 athletes competing across 20 bodyweight categories, a year on from the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games and at the beginning of a new Paralympic Qualification Pathway.
Here is a shortlist of the world's best athletes to watch at the Elite Championships:
The 28-year-old Clara Fuentes is stepping up from the women’s up to 50kg category to test her fortunes in the women’s up to 55kg class, a year after winning gold at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.

Cairo 2025 Preview: Paralympic champions return for world glory,"The world’s strongest Para athletes have taken centre stage in Egypt for eight days of thrilling competition as the Cairo 2025 World Para Powerlifting Championships unfold from 11 to 18 October. This marks the first time the event is being held in Africa.
Action at the New Capital Sports Hall began with the Rookie & Next Gen World Championships on 9-10 October, featuring 11 bodyweight categories for athletes aged 20 or under. The spotlight now shifts to the Elite World Championships.
A total of 70 National Paralympic Committees will be represented by 537 athletes — 311 men and 226 women. Most notably, all Paralympic champions from the Paris 2024 Games are competing in Cairo, marking the beginning of the qualification pathway for the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympics.
“First day of competition is always exciting. We started off well, the athletes are happy and that is the most important thing for me,” said Massimo Dighe, Acting Head of World Para Powerlifting at the opening press conference in Cairo on Thursday (9 October).
Athletes will compete across 20 bodyweight categories — 10 for women and 10 for men — over seven days, followed by three team events on the final competition day.
Host country Egypt is fielding the largest contingent with 33 athletes, followed by Brazil (25), China (23), and India and Uzbekistan (22 each).
In terms of gender representation, Brazil leads with 16 female athletes, including four Paralympic medallists from Paris 2024. Egypt dominates among men with 19 competitors.
All gold medallists from Paris 2024 are returning to the stage — though some are moving up categories. Venezuela’s Clara Fuentes set off a domino effect by moving from the women’s up to 50kg to the 55kg class.
In turn, Egypt’s Rehab Ahmed moved to the up to 61kg category, Nigeria’s Onyinyechi Mark switched to up to 67kg, and China’s Yujiao Tan joined Paralympic champion Mariana D’Andrea in the women’s up to 73kg class.
The other major move comes from Italy’s Donato Telesca, who shifts from the men’s up to 72kg to the 88kg division. The Paralympic bronze medallist and Dubai 2023 silver medallist will now face China’s Panpan Yan instead of Malaysia’s Bonnie Bunyau Gustin.
“It will be an amazing fight with this champion,” commented Telesca on World Para Powerlifting’s Instagram post about the Chinese competitor last week.
Four-time Paralympic champion and five-time World champion Amalia Pérez of Mexico will not compete in Cairo, ending a run of seven consecutive World Championships.
Her debut dates back to 2002 in Kuala Lumpur, where she claimed silver and began a streak of six consecutive World medals — broken at Dubai 2023, where she finished fourth in the women’s up to 67kg before taking bronze at the Paris 2024 Paralympics.
The action begins at 10:00 am local time on 11 October with the men’s up to 80kg category, opening the Elite Championships. Iran’s Roohallah Rostami will be aiming for his third World Championships gold in what will be his seventh appearance among the elite.
Across seven days, three categories will be contested daily, except on 17 October, when only two events take place — the women’s up to 86kg and the men’s over 107kg — with another Iranian, Ahmad Aminzadeh, defending his title.
Live results from all the Cairo 2025 action are available on the World Para Powerlifting website. All categories will also be live streamed via the Paralympic Games YouTube channel.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/cairo-2025-world-para-powerlifting-championships-preview,paralympic.org,admin,
Cairo 2025: World records galore as Iran get first ever women world champion,"The second and final day of the Cairo 2025 Rookie & Next Gen World Championships was highlighted by several powerful performances, with world records shattered and new stars emerging on the global stage.This was the largest ever Rookie & Next Gen World Championships with 120 athletes (36 female and 84 male athletes), aged 20 or younger, competed in 19 events spanned over two days for the first time.
This will be followed by the Elite World Championships, taking place from 11 to 18 October — marking the first time the event is being hosted not only in Egypt but also in Africa. It is also among the biggest championships ever staged in Egypt, following the African Open Championships in 2022 and the World Cups in 2023 and 2024.
Iranian junior athletes stole the show on the final day of the Rookie and Next Gen competitions. Much like their senior counterparts, Iran’s junior athletes delivered a dominant performance in the heavyweight categories, matching the strength and skill of the Uzbek athletes – who led the first day show.
Atiyehsadat Hosseini, 17, made history winning Iran’s first-ever women’s gold in World Para Powerlifting Championships history, triumphing in the women’s up to 61kg category.
“I’m so happy and proud to get the gold here,” said Hosseini who grabbed the gold with her second attempt of 90kg.
The men followed the suit too with several gold medals on the day in both Rookie & Next Gen category. Many Saeedi clinched the gold medal in men’s up to 88kg category (Next Gen) in style. The 19-year-old began his campaign setting a new world record with 166kg before bettering it with 172kg on his second attempt.
Reza Enayatollahi celebrated his 18th birthday in advance, clinching the men’s up to 97kg category with a new Next Gen world record of 195kg in his second attempt.
“I worked hard for 11 years for this result. I believe the key to success is hard work and listening to your coach,” said Enayatollahi who aims for a medal at Paralympic Games.
Powerhouse Uzbekistan also continued their good run at Cairo 2025 clinching five gold medals on the final day of the Rookie & Next Gen World Championships.
Jasurbek Yuldoshov proved once again why the nation is among the best in sport as the 19-year-old won his second World Championship gold medal breaking the world record twice.
Starting with a powerful 175kg, he broke the Next Gen world record with a successful lift of 181kg before going for 185kg - a new record. The athlete, who has been training for past seven years, came back for the powerlift only to set a new record at 190kg.
""Powerlifting has brought positive impact in my life. I love to be competitive and be a champion,"" sid a proud Yuldoshov.
Earlier, Paralympian Rukhshona Uktamova began the day with a golden note for Uzbekistan. The Dubai 2023 Worlds rookie champion convincingly won the women’s up to 67kg with a 119kg lift in her third attempt which was also a new world record.
It will be exciting to see if she can repeat it in the Elite Championships.
Gulyuz Nematullaeva’s debut campaign at the Worlds was highlight of the Uzbekistan team too.
The 19-year-old broke the world record for Next Gen twice, first at 105kg and then going for a successful 110kg in her fourth (Powerlift) attempt – enough to take gold in the women’s up to 73kg category. “I’m very happy and excited. I believe that we should always strive for excellence. Today, I achieved one of my goals,” said Nematullaeva who has a gold from World Ability Games 2024.
Malaysia’s Paralympic champion Bonnie Bunyau Gustin will soon have a company in the men’s up to 72kg category as a new star was born in Cairo.
Akmal Mohamad Supi displayed courage and determination to win the men’s up to 72kg rookie category with a world record effort. The 17-year-old from Perak, a state in Malaysia, grabbed the gold with a lift of 167kg in his second attempt.
“I’m happy and excited. It was my first international competition, and I was nervous too. I have been working hard but plan to put in more hours in training to prepare for upcoming important events,” said Mohamad Supi, who idolises Powerlifting giants Gustin and Abdelkareem Khattab.
“I want to qualify for the LA2028 Games,” he added.
USA too made their first presence at the medals thanks to the golden efforts of Brett Forbes who lifted 170kg to win the men’s over 107kg category.
After two days of exciting Rookie & Next Gen competition, Uzbekistan led the medals standings with 21 medals including 13 gold followed by Armenia and I.R. Iran with four top places. Hosts Egypt finish the junior events on three gold medals.

Day 2: 'Flying Fish' Jiang Yuyan smashes world record for second gold,"Last week, China’s Jiang Yuyan was unsure whether she would be fit enough to compete at the Toyota World Para Swimming Championships Singapore 2025.
On Monday, the Para swimming superstar made it two world titles in two days as she won the women’s 100m freestyle S6 final, promising that her career peak lies beyond her Paris 2024 medal haul.
On the second day of action at the OCBC Aquatic Centre, the 20-year-old beat runner-up Anna Hontar from Ukraine by 4.28 seconds in a new world record time of 1:09.58.
Jiang, known as the Flying Fish, was only 14 when she claimed gold in the event at her breakthrough World Championships in London in 2019. Since then, she has gone from strength to strength, picking up seven gold medals at last year’s Paralympic Games.
""After Paris, some people may think that I've reached my peak. But I aim to create even higher peaks,” Jiang said.
This year’s Laureus Award winner has, however, been recovering from a shoulder injury and only knew one week ago that she was going to compete. In Singapore, she has shown no sign of it.
With her trademark strength, a single-arm, hip-driven freestyle, Monday’s final became a race against the clock for the world record holder, who knocked a 10th of a second off her own mark from last year’s Paralympic Games.
""The charm of competitive sports lies in its unpredictability,” Jiang said.
""There may be some differences between the races I'm here to compete but, I hope to compete for gold in all my individual events.”
Switzerland’s Nora Meister claimed bronze to make it the same trio on the podium as when Jiang won Sunday’s women’s 100m backstroke S6 final.
Germany’s Josia Tim Alexander Topf produced an emotional victory in the men’s 150m individual medley SM3, his mother screaming with joy in front of a TV next to the pool.
The 22-year-old Paralympic champion followed up his Paris 2024 triumph with a world title, finishing in 2:55.06 to beat runner-up Ahmed Kelly from Australia by just over nine seconds. Italy’s Gabriele Lorenzo clinched bronze.
Topf had started the race strongly, with a significant lead after the backstroke 50m, but was chased down by the field in the breaststroke. Coming into the last 50m stretch of freestyle, he was neck and neck with Kelly but managed to push away from the Australian with an impressive freestyle leg.
It was the first World Championships gold medal for Topf, who had finished in second place at the 2022 edition of the competition, in Funchal, Portugal, missing the 2023 Worlds in Manchester, Great Britain, due to a stomach virus. Gabriel Geraldo dos Santos Araujo from Brazil finished in fifth place, breaking his own SM2 world record.
Debutant Defne Kurt from Turkiye added another gold medal to her maiden World Championships campaign as she won the women’s 200m individual medley SM10 final by a narrow margin.
Sunday’s 50m Freestyle S10 winner finished 0.22 seconds ahead of Great Britain’s Faye Rogers to clinch her second world title in two days. Lisa Kruger from the Netherlands won the bronze medal, 3.77 seconds behind the winner.
She is not the only swimmer with a perfect record in Singapore so far. Germany’s Tanja Scholz, who won the women’s 150m individual medley SM3 final, Great Britain’s Alice Tai, who finished first in the women’s 100m backstroke S8, and Poppy Maskill, who won the women’s 100m backstroke S14 final with a championship record, as well as David Kratochvil from Czechia, who claimed the men’s 100m butterfly S11 gold medal and Ami Omer Dadaon from Israel, who triumphed in the men’s 100m freestyle S4, also made it two world titles in two days.
Germany’s Taliso Engel set a new world record as he won the men’s 100m breaststroke SB13 final, cutting 0.15 seconds off his own mark from Paris 2024.
Benjamin Hance from Australia could win the men’s 100m backstroke S14 gold medal with plenty of confidence in the final, having set a new world record in the heats.
Swimmers from Canada, Italy, United States and Spain also won gold medals in Singapore on Monday, as the second day of competition concluded with Ukraine's victory in the mixed 4x50 freestyle relay 20pts final, where Brazil claimed silver and United States bronze.
Italy lead the overall standings with 15 medals, including six first places. China are in second place, also with six gold medals, followed by Great Britain, on five.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/day-2-flying-fish-jiang-yuyan-smashes-world-record-second-gold,paralympic.org,admin,

Gold Coast to host 2026 Para Swimming World Series Australia,"Swimming Australia, Experience Gold Coast and City of Gold Coast have announced on Monday (13 October) that the Para Swimming World Series Australia will be held in Gold Coast for the first time in 2026.
Chiefly, the relocation from Melbourne comes after the unveiling of the outdoor venue for the 2028 Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. The move gives Australian and international Para swimmers the chance to experience outdoor conditions as they prepare for the Games.
 
For LA28, Para swimming will be held at a new, temporary outdoor aquatics centre in Long Beach.
Next year’s World Series Australia will also mark the first time Para swimmers will compete in their own stand-alone event in the country.
 
The Gold Coast’s World Series is set to be held from 20-22 February at Gold Coast Aquatic Centre, opening the 2026 Para Swimming World Series season at one of Australia’s premier aquatic venues.
 
Next year’s event will also be the last chance for Australian athletes to secure selection for the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, with the qualification period ending on 26 February.
 
This series also provides a platform for international classification and competition for Para swimmers across the world.
At today’s announcement Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate said: “What a coup. The 2026 World Series will be the first time the Coast has hosted this global swimming event and we are proud of showcasing our para stars – and potential Commonwealth Games Dolphins – as the main event.”
 
 “Hosting these championships not only highlights the incredible sporting prowess of the world’s best Para athletes but equally, helps shine a light on the city’s sports facilities as we count down to the 2032 Olympics and Paralympics. I applaud Swimming Australia and World Para Swimming for showing faith in the Coast. We will deliver.’’
 
Swimming Australia General Manager of Paralympic Program Anna Johnson, added:

“We also thank Swimming Victoria for their support in delivering this event alongside their Victorian Open Championships over a number of years and giving our athletes to chance to compete internationally on home shores.”",https://www.paralympic.org/news/gold-coast-host-2026-para-swimming-world-series-australia,paralympic.org,admin,
Guillaume Junior Atangana: From Refugee to World Champion,"In a moment that will echo through the history of Para athletics, Guillaume Junior Atangana sprinted to victory in the men’s 400m T11 final at the 2025 World Para Athletics Championships in New Delhi, becoming the first-ever refugee athlete to win a world title. Guided by Donard Ndim Nyamjua, also a refugee athlete, Atangana crossed the finish line in a season-best time of 51.95 seconds, securing a landmark win that symbolises resilience, determination, and the power of sport.
His journey to India was made possible through an International Paralympic Committee (IPC) competition grant for refugee athletes. The grant, part of the broader Sport for Mobility programme, is designed to increase access to international competition events for persons with disabilities at all levels — from grassroots to elite competition. It enabled Atangana and his guide to travel to New Delhi and compete, overcoming one of the many barriers refugee athletes often face in reaching the international stage.
The Sport for Mobility programme is funded thanks to a grant from the Toyota Mobility Foundation, and is a cornerstone of the IPC’s commitment to Para sport for development. By working with member organisations, the IPC is strengthening the sport ecosystem, developing athletes, and building inclusive communities. Through investments in athlete development, leadership, and participation, the programme includes support for training and competition opportunities for Refugee Paralympic Team athletes.
Atangana first competed at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, finishing fourth in the 400m T11, just shy of a medal. He later fled to England, where he continued training and eventually qualified for the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games as part of the Refugee Paralympic Team (RPT).
Atangana was also selected as one of two flagbearers for the RPT during the Opening Ceremony in Paris, a moment he learned of during a personal call from IPC President Andrew Parsons. He went on to win bronze in the 400m T11 at the Games, becoming a symbol of hope for more than 120 million displaced persons worldwide. His gold medal in New Delhi almost a year later is not only a personal triumph but a powerful statement for refugees and people with disabilities everywhere.
Atangana said: “For me, it’s a great honour to have won this medal, to be the first refugee athlete to win a gold medal at the World Para Athletics Championships. And I’m very happy about it. I know this is just the beginning. I will continue working [hard].
“My message to all refugees around the world is simply: do sport! With sport, it’s not just about winning medals or becoming a great champion. First of all, sport helps us in our daily lives, it helps with health. It protects us from stress. Doing sport is a very good thing, and through sport, we have fun.
“There are no limits. Even if you’re a refugee, no matter where you are, there are organisations out there to help us. So, you can keep following your dream.”
Kristina Molloy, IPC’s Deputy Chief Executive Officer, reflected on the significance of his achievement: “Guillaume’s victory is more than a sporting milestone, it’s a profound reminder of what’s possible when we invest in inclusive pathways for persons with disabilities. Through the Sport for Mobility programme, we’re not just helping athletes reach the starting line or the podium; we’re reducing barriers to access and supporting a new generation of Para sport heroes.
“This initiative is about more than medals, it’s about dignity, opportunity, and hope. Guillaume’s journey is just one example of how Para sport can be a catalyst for a more inclusive world. His story is a testament to the transformational power of sport to transcend borders, barriers, and adversity.”",https://www.paralympic.org/news/guillaume-junior-atangana-refugee-world-champion,paralympic.org,admin,

IPC appoints Kristina Molloy as Deputy CEO,"The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has appointed Kristina Molloy as its Deputy Chief Executive Officer. Molloy, who joined the IPC in 2022 as Chief Membership and Impact Officer, is a proven executive, a long-standing advocate for accessibility and inclusion, and is highly regarded by colleagues and stakeholders.
Molloy's appointment as Deputy CEO represents an important milestone in the development of the IPC, helps the organisation meet the growing demands of the business and its members, and strengthens critical elements of business continuity and succession planning in an otherwise robust structure of executive leadership.
Since she joined the IPC in 2022, Molloy has led initiatives to strengthen member engagement and member support and services, advance disability inclusion, and showcase the impact of the Paralympic Movement’s activities. Her leadership has been instrumental in driving forward the IPC’s mission and championing inclusive access to Para sport for persons with disabilities — at both grassroots and elite levels.
In her new role, Molloy will support the CEO in the daily management of the IPC, an organisation that celebrates having nearly 50 different nationalities represented on its team and is responsible for delivering the IPC’s strategic plan. She also will support the CEO to innovate new resource streams for increased support of IPC members. Molloy will cascade some of her existing responsibilities to colleagues within Team IPC but will continue to spearhead the IPC’s overall efforts to support its members and build and deliver the IPC’s new impact strategy.
Dr Mike Peters PLY, IPC CEO, said: ""I am really excited to appoint Kristina as Deputy CEO of the IPC. She brings tremendous value to the organisation and to serving our members. Her proven leadership skills, strategic vision, deep understanding of our Movement, and her contagious joy for the work we do has and will be a vital resource for our purpose-driven sports organisation.""
Kristina Molloy said: ""I’m really looking forward to stepping into the role of Deputy CEO and continuing to work alongside our members, athletes, and partners to advance the transformative power of Para sport.
“The IPC sits at the intersection of sport and disability and is uniquely positioned to drive lasting global change and improve the lives of the world’s 1.3 billion persons with disabilities. I am thrilled to be able to play my part and work closely with Mike to help lead the organisation in the delivery of our mission and vision.”
Prior to joining the IPC, Molloy held senior roles within the Government of Canada, including serving as Director of Policy to several Ministers responsible for Sport and for Disability Inclusion.  She played a key role in shaping Canada’s first federal accessibility legislation and has contributed to the planning of multiple Paralympic Games, starting with Vancouver 2010.
The IPC’s senior executive leadership team includes CEO Mike Peters, Deputy CEO Kristina Molloy, Executive Director Paralympic Games Colleen Wrenn, Chief Brand and Communications Officer Craig Spence, General Counsel Liz Riley, and Managing Director of World Para Sports and Interim Director of Operations Christian Holtz. It is responsible for managing the IPC’s day-to-day activities, which aim to fulfil the organisation’s strategic objectives.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-appoints-kristina-molloy-deputy-ceo,paralympic.org,admin,
IPC to open historic 'Change Starts with Sport' exhibition in 2026,"To commemorate the anniversary of its founding on 22 September 1989, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has unveiled plans for a new permanent exhibition, set to open in 2026 at its Campus in Bonn, Germany.
The exhibition will feature Paralympic medals, torches, mascots, and sport equipment, alongside interactive zones that explore the rich history and transformational impact of the Paralympic Movement. Designed to inform and inspire, the exhibition will celebrate the achievements of Para athletes and the evolution of Para sport worldwide.
Courtesy of funding from Aktion Mensch and the Landschaftsverband Rheinland (LVR) the immersive “Change Starts with Sport” exhibition will feature multiple interactive zones that celebrate sport performance and the power of Para sport in advancing disability inclusion and driving social change. It will showcase role models from Para sports and provide knowledge on rights, participation, and inclusion of persons with disabilities.
Designed with inclusion and accessibility at its core, the exhibition will include audio guides, descriptive audio videos, tactile interfaces and Easy Read text to read or listen to. All exhibits will be optimised for wheelchair users and people with short stature. Audio descriptions will include accompanying sign language versions. A mascot gallery will also be part of the exhibit, as will an original podium from the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.
The exhibition will span 800 square metres and feature five dynamic zones that each explore a unique facet of the Paralympic Movement, from its historical roots and global impact to the vibrant community of athletes and members and partners who help drive it forward.  At its centre will be the striking ‘medals wall’, a tribute to Paralympic excellence featuring gold, silver, and bronze medals from every Games since Rome 1960. While its heritage collection grows, the IPC will feature certain medals through generous loans and donations from past Paralympians, ensuring their legacy is celebrated and preserved.
In parallel, the IPC will launch a complementary online exhibition featuring 3D models of medals, torches and other Paralympic items, as well as oral histories, archival documents, and educational resources. The digital platform will extend the exhibition’s reach to a global audience, with a goal of engaging half a million visitors by 2030.
Dr Mike Peters PLY, the IPC’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “This historic Paralympic exhibition is more than a celebration of sport, it’s a platform for education, empowerment, and social change. By showcasing the stories, achievements, and legacy of the Paralympic Movement, we aim to inspire a new generation who embrace diversity, see strength in difference, and drive equity for people with disabilities.
“We are incredibly grateful to Aktion Mensch and the Landschaftsverband Rheinland for their support because they are helping to make a magical reality out of what has been a near 30-year-long dream for the IPC. We look forward to welcoming visitors both in-person and online from next year.”
The physical exhibition is scheduled to open by autumn 2026, followed by the online launch before the end of the year.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-change-starts-sport-exhibition-2026,paralympic.org,admin,
IPC General Assembly votes not to maintain NPC Russia’s partial suspension,"On Saturday (27 September) at the IPC General Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, IPC member organisations voted not to maintain the partial suspension of the National Paralympic Committee of Russia.
Having been partially suspended at the 2023 IPC General Assembly for breaches of its constitutional membership obligations, this decision means NPC Russia now regain their full rights and privileges of IPC membership, in accordance with the IPC Constitution. The IPC will work with NPC Russia to put practical arrangements in place for this as soon as reasonably possible.
In reaching their decisions, IPC member organisations made up of National Paralympic Committees, International Federations and International Organisations of Sport for the Disabled attending the 2025 IPC General Assembly first voted against a motion to fully suspend NPC Russia (111-55 with 11 abstentions). IPC member organisations then voted against a motion to partially suspend NPC Russia (91-77 with 8 abstentions), meaning the NPC regained its full IPC membership rights. For a motion to be passed, a majority of 50%+ 1 of all votes cast was required.
Later today the IPC General Assembly will discuss the membership status of NPC Belarus.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-general-assembly-votes-not-maintain-npc-russia-s-partial-suspension,paralympic.org,admin,
IPC launches new impact strategy to drive global disability inclusion,"The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) launched its first-ever Impact Strategy on Wednesday (24 September), a landmark publication that aims to better demonstrate how Para sport is a powerful driver of societal change and global disability inclusion. Alongside this document, the IPC also published the IPC Impact Insights Catalogue which highlights global data and best practice from within the Paralympic Movement.
Unveiled following a year of consultation with stakeholders, the IPC Impact Strategy marks a pivotal moment in the IPC’s evolution. While the IPC remains a sports organisation at its core, the Impact Strategy reaffirms its role as a global leader in advancing disability inclusion. By being able to better measure and demonstrate the global impact of its activities and services, the IPC hopes to further support its 210 plus member organisations and the Para athletes they serve.
The IPC Impact Strategy focuses on four interconnected impact areas that seek to address inequalities faced by the world’s 1.3 billion persons with disabilities (over 15 per cent of the global population):
Para Sport for development – increase opportunities for persons with disabilities to engage in Para sport and physical activity at all levels and in all contexts.
Paralympic Games legacy – deliver transformational Paralympic Games as a global platform to showcase sporting excellence, challenge stigma, and promote disability inclusion, leaving legacies in the host city and beyond.
Partnership and global advocacy – develop strategic partnerships that enhance global advocacy for disability inclusion, promote and support implementation of policy change, and drive investment in Para sport.
Empirical evidence base – improve data collection, analysis and research of Para sport and physical activity, and advance advocacy for better data infrastructure to credibly showcase the impact and effects of the IPC and Paralympic Movement.
Kristina Molloy, the IPC’s Deputy Chief Executive Officer, said: “Without doubt, Para sport is an extremely powerful tool for driving societal change and advancing disability inclusion. The launch of the IPC Impact Strategy marks a major milestone in the Paralympic Movement’s history.
“Whether it is the platform of the Paralympic Games or Para sport development programmes, our activities have a monumental impact, challenging stigma, empowering individuals, and building inclusive communities.
“To truly deliver on the IPC’s vision to make for an inclusive world through Para sport, we need to articulate and expand on the impact we have in advancing social change, which is where the IPC Impact Strategy comes in.
“Be being able to better measure and demonstrate the impact of the IPC’s activities, we will be able to further support our members and athletes. By partnering with like-minded organisations and institutions, the IPC will advocate for and work towards focusing global attention on systemic changes required for disability inclusion.”
Dr Mike Peters PLY, IPC Chief Executive Officer, said: “The IPC is a sports organisation first and foremost; Para sport is what we do. At the same time, our work in Para sport is grounded in the social movement of disability rights. This social movement requires us all to lean in and contribute, not only because we understand the strength of difference, but because we know that the finish line can be realised only once we live in an equitable world.
“The Impact Strategy will explain what impact means to the IPC, bring members and stakeholders together around this shared purpose, and ultimately provide evidence of the power of Para sport to change communities, nations and societies. In addition, the IPC Impact Insights Catalogue will serve as a tremendous resource showcasing the great work of our members and other organisations, as well as bringing together in one place a whole host of data that our members will find useful.”
To coincide with the publication of the IPC Impact Strategy, the IPC has also published the IPC Impact Insights Catalogue thanks to significant input from IPC members. This document brings together in one place a comprehensive range of data, research, case studies and best practice relating to disability, the benefits of Para sport and physical activity, and the societal legacies of the Paralympic Games.  It is hoped the document will highlight the great work being done by IPC members and be a valuable resource in advancing their own Para sport programmes and disability inclusion activities.
The IPC has also launched specific online channels dedicated to impact. The website www.paralympic.org/impact provides further details about the four key focus areas of the IPC Impact Strategy and details the wide-range of programmes and services that the IPC offers and provides to its member organisations.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-launches-new-impact-strategy,paralympic.org,admin,

IPC welcomes three new members at 2025 General Assembly,"The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) welcomed three new members to its growing Paralympic family at the 2025 IPC General Assembly in Seoul, Korea, on 26 September 2025.
The new members were officially ratified by IPC members on the first day of the General Assembly, bringing the IPC’s membership to 211 organisations, including 185 National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) and 18 International Federations (IFs). The new members are the NPCs of Boliva and South Sudan, and the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC).
Bolivia becomes the 34th NPC from the Americas region to join the IPC.
Commenting on the announcement, President of NPC Bolivia Rodrigo Castro said: “The Bolivian Paralympic Committee is proud to officially become a member of the IPC. This milestone represents a major step forward for the Paralympic Movement in Bolivia. It is a meaningful achievement and brings well-deserved recognition to persons with disabilities who participate in Para sport across Bolivia. Our membership reflects our commitment to inclusion and sporting excellence.”
South Sudan, the world’s youngest nation, is now the 49th NPC from the African region to join the IPC.
Kim Bany Joak, Secretary General of NPC South Sudan said: “This formal admission of NPC South Sudan as a member of the IPC marks a  new chapter in our journey to achieving inclusive Sports for athletes with disabilities, provided that an infrastructure for the sports development is at the centre of this membership, we shall stop at nothing but exciting and inspiring  the world as champions with limitless power to compete.”
Previously an IPC Recognised Federation, the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) is now the 18th international sports federation to become an IPC member due to its inclusion in the LA28 Paralympic Games sport programme.
The President of IFSC, Marco Scolaris, said: “Climbing has made remarkable progress in just a few years, and recognition from the IPC marks another important milestone on this journey. At its core, the IFSC is committed to inclusivity and to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to climb. Becoming part of the IPC family reaffirms to the world what our community has long known: climbing is for all.
“We have worked with dedication to join the Paralympic Movement, and we are deeply grateful to the IPC for their trust and support as we continue to promote and grow Para Climbing within the wider Para sports family. This recognition provides our athletes with the global stage they deserve to demonstrate their talent, passion, and resilience. The entire climbing family is now united to climb together.”",https://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-welcomes-three-new-members-2025,paralympic.org,admin,
Italy clinches B-Pool title ahead of home Paralympic Winter Games,"Italy received a major boost ahead of hosting the Paralympic Winter Games next year, defeating Japan on Thursday to claim the World Para Ice Hockey Championships B-Pool title in Astana, Kazakhstan.
Both Italy and Japan will return to the A-Pool in 2027 as the top two finishers. The Azzurri completed an unbeaten run in Astana, sealing the title with a 4–2 win over Japan on the final day of the round-robin tournament.
Promotion had already been secured by both teams before the last game day. Sweden earned the bronze medal and a spot in the Milano Cortina 2026 Paralympic Winter Games Qualification Tournament with a commanding 13–0 win over France. The Qualification Tournament will take place in Jessheim, Norway, in December.
As hosts of the next Paralympic Games, Italy has the option to participate in the Qualification Tournament. If they choose to do so, they will join Sweden, Japan, and the bottom three teams from this year’s A-Pool: Slovakia, Korea, and Norway.
If Italy decides not to participate, they will retain the automatic 8th seed position at the Winter Games. In that case, Kazakhstan — the next best-ranked team from the B-Pool —will advance to the Qualification Tournament in Jessheim.
Kazakhstan, the host nation, finished fourth after a 5–2 win over Finland on Thursday. Finland placed fifth, while France ended sixth and will be relegated to the C-Pool in 2027.
•    Best Goalkeeper: Ulf Nilsson (Sweden)
•    Best Defenceman: Nikko Landeros (Italy)

"New Delhi 2025: First for Kumar, fifth for Ferreira in day of surprises","Brazil’s Petrucio Ferreira started off the IndianOil New Delhi 2025 World Para Athletics Championships with a bang on Saturday as he won a thrilling men's 100m T47 final, claiming his fifth consecutive world title in the event.
In the first of nine days of action at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the fastest Paralympian on the planet made a strong push in the last 30m of the race to clinch the victory by two hundredths of a second, ahead of China’s runner-up Shi Kangjun. Aymane El Haddaoui of Morocco won the bronze.
""The fifth title was harder than the first,” said Ferreira, who won the Men’s 100m T47 at London 2017, Dubai 2019, Paris 2023 and Kobe 2024 as well as at the past three Paralympic Games.
""The competitiveness and the pressure I put on my body, defending my titles, is always increasing.”
After realising that he had done it again, he celebrated the narrow win with five fingers in the air.
""I've been undefeated in this event for 12 years. This isn't just physical, it's psychological as well. For that, I have to thank my family. I enjoy challenges,” he said.
New Delhi 2025: Here are the medallists from day one
Shailesh Kumar won India’s first gold medal of the championships as he sealed the victory in the men’s high jump T63 with a championship record of 1.91. USA’s Paralympic champion and world record-holder Ezra Frech cleared 1.85m in his first attempt to take the silver medal ahead of another home jumper – India’s bronze medallist Varun Singh Bhati – who also jumped 1.85 but needed three tries for it.
""We came here nearly ten days ago and it feels good to win a (gold) medal in front of the home crowd,” said Kumar, from the village of Islamnagar, 200km east of New Delhi.
""The target was always big, but I am happy with my performance and hoping for much better in the next championships.”
Three world records were set in the first day of action at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi, India as the best Para athletes on the planet battled it out for the championships’ first 12 gold medals.
China’s DI Dongdong won the men’s long jump T11 final with a world record jump of 6.92, adding 7cm to his previous record set at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games to win the gold medal by a margin of 12cm to his teammate Chen Shichang in second place.
Thekra Alkaabi of the United Arab Emirates broke the 20-second barrier in the women’s 100m T71 final as she won in 19.89 seconds, knocking 19 hundredths of a second off the previous world record set by Lithuania’s Bella Morkus in July.
Morkus had to settle for a silver medal in 21.53 seconds this time as Poland’s Miriam Dominikowska won bronze.
Alkaabi and the men’s 100m T71 champion – Artur Krzyzek of Poland – also made history as the first 100m T71 champions as the event made its debut in the Para athletics World Championships programme.
Turkiye’s Aysel Onder improved her own world record from Paris 2024 as she won the women’s 400m T20 gold medal in 54.51 seconds, beating runner-up Deepthi Jeevanji of India by 0.65 seconds. The home hope had a strong start and led the race coming into the last 100m. In the home straight, however, Paralympic champion Onder, 20, pushed past her to claim the victory as Ukraine’s Yuliia Shuliar won bronze.
Japan’s Karasawa Kenya upset Brazil’s Paralympic champion Julio Cesar Agripino and world champion Yeltsin Jacques in the men’s 5000m T11 final. The Brazilian world record-holder had led the race from the beginning to the 2800m-mark when Karasawa took over a lead that he kept until the finish line.
The 31-year-old Japanese won in 15:23.38 as Jacques had to settle for a silver, crossing the line more than six seconds behind. Ecuador’s Darwin Gustavo Castro Reyes took the bronze.
Colombia’s Mayerli Buitrago Ariza and Kubaro Khakimova of Uzbekistan produced another great upset on the opening night of the World Championships as they denied Tunisia’s Para sport icon Raoua Tlili the first place in the women’s shot put F41. The five-time shot put world champion, with four consecutive Paralympic titles to her name, holds the world record of 10.55 but had to settle for a bronze medal at 9.96 in Saturday’s final as Buitrago Ariza and Khakimova, with 10.21 and 10.17 respectively, grabbed the gold and silver.
""After so many years fighting hard to achieve this, and after not taking a medal in Paris, here is the result of all the dedication and hard work,” the 38-year-old Colombian winner said.
""That’s what I am, I’m a warrior woman. I’m the world champion in India.”
The Netherlands had a strong start to the competition with two gold medals in the first day, earning an early second place in the overall medal table after China. Noelle Roorda won the Women’s Javelin Throw F46 with a new personal best throw of 43.74 as Cheyenne Bouthoorn produced a personal best to take the Women’s Shot Put F36 world title with 9.62m.

New Delhi 2025: Five female athletes to watch,"Over 1,200 athletes will compete at the IndianOil New Delhi 2025 World Para Athletics Championships, held from 27 September to 5 October in India. Among them are more than 200 Paralympic medallists and just as many World Championships podium finishers, making this one of the most competitive editions to date.
Here are five female athletes to watch in New Delhi:
The most successful Para athletics athlete at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, Debrunner claimed five gold medals and one silver. The Swiss wheelchair racer has eight World Championships medals, including five golds – four of which came at her last Worlds appearance in Paris. Her achievements earned her the Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability Award in 2023.
Debrunner’s busy schedule includes the women’s 100m T53 (day six, 2 October), women’s 400m T53 (day seven, 3 October), women’s 800m T53 (day three, 29 September), women’s 1500m T54 (day five, 1 October) and 5000m T54 (day two, 28 September).
Since her breakout performance at the Paris 2023 World Championships, Jong has dominated the T64 class. She won gold in both the 100m T64 and long jump T64 in Paris, defended her titles in Kobe, and repeated her success at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.
Jong will compete in the women’s 100m T64 on day five (1 October) and in the women’s long jump T64 on day seven (3 October).
With frame running set to make its Paralympic debut at LA2028, Poland’s Andruszkiewicz is already a standout in the discipline. She is the reigning world champion in the 100m T72 and took silver in Paris 2023.
Her campaign begins on day two (28 September) in the 400m T72 final, followed by the 100m T72 on day four (30 September).
Tunisia’s throwing queen will celebrate her 36th birthday on 5 October, the final day of the Championships—and she’s hoping to mark the occasion with more gold. Tlili has 11 World Championships titles (six in shot put, five in discus) and eight Paralympic golds.
She will compete in the shot put F41 on opening day (27 September) and the discus throw F41 on day seven (3 October).
Wen has consistently returned home from major competitions with a suitcase full of medals. At Paris 2024, she won gold in the 100m T37, 200m T37, long jump T37, and the 4x100m universal relay. She also has five Paralympic golds from Rio and Tokyo, and eight World Championships titles, including four from Kobe 2024.
Wen will compete in three individual events in New Delhi:
Long jump T37 on day one (27 September)
400m T37 on day two (28 September)

New Delhi 2025: Five male athletes to watch,"Over 1,200 athletes will compete at the IndianOil New Delhi 2025 World Para Athletics Championships, taking place from 27 September to 5 October in India. Among them are more than 200 Paralympic medallists and just as many World Championships podium finishers, making this one of the most competitive editions yet.
Here are five male athletes to watch in New Delhi:
The fastest T11 sprinter on the planet, the 25-year-old arrives in India aiming to add a second World Championships gold to his collection. Ghavelas is a two-time Paralympic champion in the men’s 100m T11 (Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024) and claimed his first world title in Paris two years ago.
He will compete in the men’s 100m T11 on day six (2 October), with heats scheduled for the morning session.
New Delhi marks the start of the new Paralympic cycle toward LA2028—a journey especially meaningful for Frech, who calls Los Angeles home. He made his World Championships debut at just 14 in Dubai 2019, and has since become a rising star.
Frech won gold in the men’s high jump T63 and silver in Kobe last year, followed by double Paralympic gold in the 100m T63 and high jump T63 at Paris 2024.
He will compete in the high jump T63 on opening day (27 September), the long jump T63 on day three (29 September), and the 100m T63 on the final day (5 October).
A former seven-a-side CP footballer, Turner made a stunning Para athletics debut with gold in the men’s 800m T36 at Rio 2016. He has since added three more Paralympic titles, including two in Paris (100m and 400m T36), and boasts seven World Championships golds—three from London 2017, two from Dubai 2019, and two from Paris 2023.
Turner will aim for a fourth world title in the 400m T36 on day two (28 September) and a third gold in the 100m T36 on day seven (3 October).
Since 2011, the men’s long jump for below-knee amputee athletes has become one of the most anticipated events at the World Championships—thanks to Markus Rehm. The German legend won his first gold in Christchurch and has since claimed seven world titles in the event, plus two relay golds.
A five-time Paralympic champion, Rehm holds the world record of 8.72m and is aiming to soar even further in New Delhi.
He will compete on day six (2 October) in the evening session.
No Paralympic athlete is faster than Petrucio Ferreira. His personal best of 10.29 seconds (set in 2022) remains unmatched, with Norway’s Salum Kashafali (T12) the closest at 10.37.
Ferreira has six World Championships golds, including four in the men’s 100m T47, and is a three-time Paralympic champion in the event.
He will be one of the stars of the opening session in the 100m T47 heats, with the final scheduled for the evening of day one (27 September).",https://www.paralympic.org/news/new-delhi-2025-five-male-athletes-watch,paralympic.org,admin,
New Delhi 2025: Fleur Jong leads the Dutch to universal relay gold,"Fleur Jong won her third gold medal of the IndianOil New Delhi 2025 World Para Athletics Championships as she led the Netherlands to victory in the universal 4x100m relay final on Saturday.
Competing alongside Zara Temmink, Stijn van Bergen and Lito Anker, the 100m and long jump T64 champion made it a clean sweep of gold medals at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium with her 10th global title.
In the universal relay, each team has two men and two women, who can compete in any of the four legs. The first 100m is run by an athlete with a visual impairment, followed by an amputee athlete and a coordination athlete before a wheelchair athlete takes the anchor leg.
The Netherlands finished with two men – van Bergen and Anker – and were well placed in second behind Australia after Jong’s leg. At the final handover, Netherlands were in the lead ahead of Indonesia, who also finished with two men. Anker managed to keep the first place across the finish line to secure the gold medal in 47.73, beating Indonesia by eight hundredths of a second as Australia, with 14-year-old Lexie Brown in the team, won bronze.
Great Britain’s Hannah Cockroft won the women’s 800m T34 final in a dominant fashion, setting a new championship record of 1:49.88. The British Para athletics superstar led the race from start to finish, with a large gap back to her opponents, bagging her third gold medal at New Delhi by a margin of more than 14 seconds. Her teammate Kare Adenegan made it a British one-two as Lan Hanyu of China claimed bronze.
“Anything under 1:50.00 is a good time, I’m super happy with the result, super happy with the gap and happy that it is over (after so many events),” said Cockroft, who has dominated the T34 events since winning her two first world titles 14 years ago.
New Delhi 2025: Here are the medallist from day eight
It was the third World Championships that the 33-year-old from Halifax in West Yorkshire, England, who also won the 100m and 400m T34, has produced a hat trick of world titles. A 19-time world champion, with nine Paralympic titles to her name, Cockroft is unbeaten in Paralympic and World Championships finals since 2011.
After crossing the line to conclude her New Delhi 2025 campaign with a gold medal, however, Cockroft quickly shifted focus towards her partner, Great Britain’s Nathan Maguire, who was racing in the men’s 800m T54 heats and qualified for Sunday's final.
“I crossed the line, and I was already thinking about his race,” Cockroft said.
“It’s so special to get to be here, I just pretended I was a bit ill after the finish line so I could stay on the side and watch to cheer him up and it’s amazing to watch him compete as well.”
Spain’s Alba Garcia Falagan won the women’s long jump T11 gold medal with a season’s best jump of 4.80 in her fourth attempt, turning a dramatic competition start into success.
“I twisted my ankle five minutes before the event, and we didn’t know if I’d be able to compete,” the 23-year-old said.
“To win gold felt like I was releasing all the tension, I’m grateful to be here and super happy of our achievements and of the team I have.”
It was the first major title for Garcia Falagan, who had claimed bronze at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games as well as in the 100m T11 in New Delhi on Wednesday, having made her international debut at the 2018 European Championships in Berlin, Germany.
France’s Tiffany Logette-Lods claimed the second place with 4.56, Arjola Dedaj of Italy finishing in third place with a jump of 4.41.
A long jump hero with more experience from the top of the podium, Ecuador’s Kiara Rodriguez won the women’s T47 final to claim her fourth consecutive long jump world title. The 22-year-old world record-holder, who had triumphed at Dubai 2019, Paris 2023 and Kobe 2024, won the final with a new Championship Record of 6.29, beating runner-up Petra Luteran of Hungary by 31cm. Denmark’s Bjoerk Noerremark took the bronze with a 5.84.
Colombia’s Levin Moreno Denis and Jose Gregorio Lemos Rivas produced a one-two in the men’s shot put F38 final, where Moreno Denis beat his teammate’s world record as he took the gold medal. The 36-year-old kicked off the competition with a winning throw of 20.38 in his first attempt, adding more than a metre to the mark set by Lemos Rivas in May this year as his teammate, also with a new personal best of 19.70, had to settle for the silver medal. Great Britain’s Michael Jenkins won bronze with a European Record of 18.84.
Iran’s Yasin Khosravi won the men’s shot put F57 final with a world record of 16.60. The 33-year-old added 59cm to his previous mark from 2023 as India’s Soman Rana claimed silver with 14.69.
Great Britain’s Daniel Pembroke claimed a third consecutive title in the men’s javelin F13. The 34-year-old double Paralympic champion, who could go for a third consecutive title at the Los Angeles 2028 Games, pulled off a season’s best throw of 68.51m when he needed it the most, beating Cuban silver medallist Ulicer Aguilera Cruz by more than five metres. Spain’s Hector Cabrera Llacer took bronze.
In the women’s shot put F12 final, Italy’s world record-holder Assunta Legnante made a dominant performance and claimed the victory with 14.44. The 47-year-old from Naples showed why she is the Paralympic champion as she beat javelin throw F13 gold medallist Zhao Yuping of China in second place by 1.77m. Great Britain’s Lydia Church claimed bronze.
In the 12 finals – six on the track, six on the field – of the eighth and penultimate day of action at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Para athletes from Belgium, Canada, Iran, Ukraine, United States and Uzbekistan won gold medals as Neutral Para Athletes Artem Kalashian and Aleksandr Iaremchuk claimed the men’s 100m T35 and 1500m T46 titles respectively.
Despite failing to make it to the top of the podium for a second consecutive day, Brazil still hold onto their lead in the overall medal standings, with 37 medals including 12 golds.

New Delhi 2025: Fortune extends golden reign with fourth consecutive world title,"Great Britain’s Sabrina Fortune won the women’s shot put F20 gold medal at the IndianOil New Delhi 2025 World Para Athletics Championships with a new world record on Monday, claiming her fourth consecutive world title in the event.
The 28-year-old Paralympic champion pulled off a throw of 16.75m in her first attempt, adding one metre to her previous mark set in Birmingham, Great Britain, last month. Ebrar Keskin of Turkiye was second best, almost three metres behind, having thrown 13.80 in her first attempt. Neutral Para Athlete Aleksandra Zaitseva took bronze.
""I’m so surprised. I just wasn’t expecting that today,” Fortune said.
“It’s so, so hot and with so many things having gone wrong in the last week, you can’t put into words how happy I am. I just want to jump up and down and run the whole track. But I feel like I might overheat if I try to do that.”
New Delhi 2025: Here are the medallists from day three
The Welsh shot putter has gone from strength to strength since winning her first world title in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2019, later adding Paralympic gold at Paris 2024. The four-time world champion, however, did not want to take all the credit for her success.
“It’s more to do with the fact that I’ve got a good coach and good places to train,” she said.
“I had a few years when I didn’t improve. Now I’m just coming back in, improving, improving and improving. And as long as you believe in yourself, it will always carry on.”
In the third day of action at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the host nation was close to producing a clean sweep in the men’s javelin throw F46 final. Rinku won the gold medal with a championship-record throw of 66.37m in his fourth of six attempts, with his teammate Sundar Singh Gurjar claiming the silver with 64.76 in his fifth attempt.
The winner comes from a small village three hours from the stadium, where he lost his arm in a farming accident as a boy. On Monday, the 26-year-old had family and friends in the loud home crowds cheering him on as he won his first world title, having claimed the silver in Paris 2023.
“I’m so thankful to my supporters and my family. Their presence encouraged me a great deal,” Rinku said. “It was my day, everything went my way, from conditions to everything else.""
India’s Ajeet Singh had held the silver medal position after pulling off 61.77 in his second attempt but could not improve further and had to settle for a fourth place after Cuba’s Guillermo Varona Gonzalez took the bronze with 63.34.
It was the second gold medal of the championships for India as the host nation take the sixth place in the overall medal standings topped by China, Brazil and Poland, all on four golds.
James Turner brought home Australia’s first gold medal of the championships as he took back the men’s 400m T63 title from New Zealand’s defending champion William Stedman.
Turner, who had to settle for a silver medal behind Stedman at last year’s World Championships in Kobe, Japan, refused to let that happen again. He led the race from start to finish, bagging his fourth world title in the event and eighth in total. Neutral Para Athlete Kirill Glazyrin made a strong last push as Turner slowed down in the last 50m and won silver, 0.07 of a second behind the Australian, as Stedman claimed bronze.
“It hurts, but it feels good,” Turner said.
“I might have gone out a little bit too hard but other than that, I executed pretty well.”
After his gold medals at London 2017, Dubai 2019 and Paris 2023, the 29-year-old Paralympic champion was happy to be back on top of the World Championships podium.
“I’ve taken back the crown,” he said.
“It means redeeming myself from last year and proving to my coach (Iryna Dvoskina), all the support staff back in Canberra, my friends and family how serious I take this and how far I’m willing to go for it.”
As Colombia made a one-two in the women’s 100m T38 final, 16-year-old world championships debutant Angie Nicoll Mejia Morales beat Paralympic champion and world record-holder Karen Tatiana Palomeque Moreno to the title by two hundredths of a second.
The South American duo pushed each other in the lead of the race as the rising star finished in 12.34 to beat her championship record from the heats.
It means back-to-back silver medals in the event for 31-year-old Palomeque Moreno, with five world titles to her name. Lida Maria Manthopoulo of Greece claimed the bronze medal.
Thailand secured two gold medals on Monday, through Pongsakorn Paeyo, who won the men’s 400m T53 title, and Chaiwat Rattana, who triumphed in the men’s 400m T34 final. Both came into their finals as world record holders, Rattana after making a mark with a new world record of 47.94 seconds in Sunday’s heat.
Para athletes from Belgium, Brazil, China, Ecuador, Latvia, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and Uzbekistan also took gold medals on Monday, as well as Neutral Para Athlete Denis Gnezdilov, who took the men’s shot put F40 title.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/new-delhi-2025-fortune-extends-golden-reign-fourth-consecutive-world-title,paralympic.org,admin,
"New Delhi 2025: Golden hat-trick for Debrunner, Sabatini bounces back in style","Switzerland’s Catherine Debrunner won her third gold medal at the IndianOil New Delhi 2025 World Para Athletics Championships on Wednesday as she clinched the women’s 1500m T54 title in a new championship record.
The 30-year-old world record-holder, who had won the 800m T53 and 5000m T54, made it a New Delhi hat-trick as she led Wednesday’s final from start to finish.
Crossing the line in 3:16.81, Debrunner beat defending world champion Zhou Zhaoqian in second place by six tenths of a second as Great Britain’s Melanie Woods won bronze.
“The Chinese seemed to be trying to box me in,” Debrunner said, referring to Zhou and teammate Tian Yajuan in fourth place.
“They talked a lot with each other, but it was a lot of fun.""
New Delhi 2025: Here are the medallists from day five
It was the ninth world title for Debrunner, from the village of Mettendorf, near Switzerland’s northern border with Germany.
After claiming her first Paralympic title at Tokyo 2020, Debrunner became a full-time Para athlete, winning five gold medals and a silver at Paris 2024. The medal haul has continued into these World Championships, where she will look for more glory in Thursday's 100m and Friday’s 400m T53.
The 100m is the only distance where Debrunner misses a gold medal, having claimed silvers in the event at the Paris 2023 World Championships as well at last year’s Paralympic Games.
“I'm still missing the world title in the 100m. Maybe I can win it tomorrow,” Debrunner said.
Italy’s Ambra Sabatini won the women’s 100m T63 gold medal, making up for an unfortunate fate that cost her a medal at Paris 2024. In the final last year, Sabatini was heading towards a second Paralympic gold medal when she stumbled and collided with her teammate Monica Contrafatto, just before the finish line.
On Wednesday, the T63 world record-holder produced an impressive comeback as she finished in 14.39, beating Indonesia’s world champion Karisma Evi Tiarani in second place by 0.26 of a second.
Ndidikama Okoh of Great Britain took the bronze, one hundredth of a second from the silver medal time.
“I’m very happy, I needed this race to go well because I need my confidence back,” said Sabatini, who had won the event at the 2023 World Championships.
Having started her New Delhi campaign with a disappointing no mark result in the women’s long jump T63 on Tuesday, the 23-year-old said she could leave India with confidence as she shifts focus towards the next Paralympic Games.
“Now I can say I’ve come back and we’re in the start of a process to Los Angeles 2028.”
Brazil’s Jerusa Geber won her fourth consecutive world title in the women’s 100m T11. The Paralympic gold medallist and world record holder, who runs with guide Gabriel Aparecido dos Santos Garcia, produced a new championship record of 11.81 in the final, beating China’s silver medallist Liu Yiming by four hundredths of a second as Alba Garcia Falagan of Spain clinched the bronze.
Breaking a championship record that her compatriot Terezinha Guilhermina set in 2011, the winner was one hundredth of a second outside of her own world record from last year’s Paralympic Games.
“It was very close to the world record,” Geber said.
“But we never know when the record will come as it is such a fast race. What we can control is to be well-prepared and give our best.”
Equalling Guilhermina as the Brazilian athlete with most World Championship medals – 12 in total – Geber said she is still hungry for more.
“The first goal was the fourth title,” the 43-year-old said.
“Now let’s go for the next, that is to win one more medal and leave the World Championships as the most successful Brazilian in history.”
Hungary’s Luca Ekler also claimed a four consecutive world title as she won the women’s long jump T38 final with a new T38 world record of 5.91.
Angie Nicoll Mejia Morales of Colombia took the silver with 5.42, her teammate Karen Tatiana Palomeque Moreno grabbing the bronze with 5.25.
“It was an amazing day,” Ekler said.
“I broke my world record twice and I’m reaching for the stars. I really want to jump six metres, it will be a new personal best, new world record and this is my dream. This is why I work every day and I’m happy that I took a step forward.”
World Record-holder and Paralympic champion Fleur Jong of the Netherlands made no mistake to beat a star-studded field of runners in the women’s 100m T64 final and win a third consecutive gold medal in the event.
The smiling 29-year-old, who will go for gold in Thursday’s long jump T64, crushed the opposition in the last half of the race, coming from behind to finish in 12.29. Her teammate Marlene van Gansewinkel made it a Dutch one-two for the second World Championships in a row as Marissa Papaconstantinou of Canada settled for the bronze.
Great Britain’s Hannah Cockroft made it two gold medals in two events at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium as she added a women’s 100m T34 title to her 400m T34 gold medal from Sunday. 
Thailand’s Chaiwat Rattana has matched Cockroft in the men’s T34 events, where he won Wednesday’s close 100m final by a margin of four hundredths of a second.
In an even closer battle for the silver medal, Rheed McCracken of Australia was three thousandths of a second ahead of Mohamad Othman from the United Arab Emirates, who had to settle for bronze.
World record-holder Wen Xiaoyan made a season’s best as she won the women’s 100m T37 final in 12.93, 0.34 of a second ahead of silver medallist Taylor Swanson from the United States.
Japan also had a successful day five at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, producing a clean podium sweep in the men’s 400m T52 final, with Sato Tomoki winning ahead of Ueyonabaru Hirokazu and Ito Tomoya.
It is Japan’s third gold at these championships, having finished on the podium 21 times at last year’s home World Championships in Kobe but failing to make it to the top spot.
USA’s Jaydin Blackwell set a new world record en route to winning the men’s 400m T38 final – the 21-year-old’s second world title in New Delhi – while Oleksandr Yarovyi of Ukraine broke the world record in the men’s shot put F20 final with a throw of 17.73.
Para athletes representing Colombia, Iran, Latvia, Spain and Uzbekistan also won World Championships gold medals on Wednesday as Neutral Para Athletes Vladimir Sviridov, Anna Kulinich-Sorokina and Aleksandr Kostin triumphed in the men’s shot put F36, women’s 400m T12 and men’s 5000m T13 respectively.
Brazil retained their lead in the overall medal table on a total of 30 medals including eight golds, with China, adding two titles to their tally on Wednesday, in second place on a total of seven gold medals.

New Delhi 2025: Jerusa Geber's gold wraps up Brazil's historic campaign,"Jerusa Geber became the most decorated Brazilian at the World Para Athletics Championships as she won the women’s 200m T11 gold medal on Sunday.
In the last day of IndianOil New Delhi 2025 action at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Geber claimed her 13th World Championship medal, one more than the dozen won by Brazil’s now second best, Terezinha Guilhermina.
The Paralympic champion, running with guide Gabriel dos Santos, came into the final 100m stretch with China’s Liu Yiming right behind her but then switched gears to take the victory in 24.88, 1.34 seconds ahead of Liu.
Geber, who equalled her compatriot’s tally as she retained her 100m T11 crown on Wednesday, pulled off a season’s best time to claim her seventh world title when she needed it the most, leaving New Delhi with two gold medals in two events.
”World Championships have concluded and I’ve reached my two goals,” she said.
""Firstly, to win the 100m for the fourth time and secondly, to become the (Brazilian) athlete with the most medals at the World Para Athletics Championships.”
Brazil’s 400m champion Thalita Simplicio claimed bronze as the South American Para athletics powerhouse secured the victory in the overall medal standings on 44 medals including 15 golds, with China in second place on 13 gold medals, despite having won more – 52 – medals in total.
New Delhi 2025: Here are all the medallists from day nine
That the competitions in New Delhi are over does not mean holiday time on Copacabana for the 43-year-old multitalented, who will go to Rio de Janeiro for a different reason.
“When I return to Brazil I will be travelling to another World Championships,” said Geber, who will pedal for more glory at the 2025 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships at Rio de Janeiro’s Velodrome, in less than two weeks.
”My pilot is already there waiting for me. I’m super happy, I can’t stop. I always want more.”
Kiara Rodriguez of Ecuador finished off another successful World Championship campaign with her third gold medal in three events in New Delhi.
The 22-year-old, who had won the women’s 100m and long jump T47 titles, won Sunday’s 200m T47 final with a new world record time. Finishing in 24.34, she knocked three hundredths of a second off her own mark set in Friday’s heats, beating runner-up Maria Clara Augusto of Brazil by 0.43 of a second as New Zealand’s Anna Grimaldi claimed bronze. The previous world record had been set by Cuba’s Yunidis Castillo at the London 2012 Paralympic Games.
“I didn’t expect this. It’s my first 200m in the World Championships; I hadn’t run the 200m in more than six years. I’m really happy and thrilled with this result,” said the three-time 100m world champion, who had never been on a global 200m podium before.
”I’ll leave India very happy, it’s been incredible. I’ve won three gold medals, I’ve broken the 200m world record twice, which hasn’t happened for 13 years. I can’t put it into words.”
Iran claimed third place in the medal standings with nine gold medals, Netherlands in fourth place on eight, much thanks to two triumphs on Sunday, through Lara Baars, who won the women’s shot put F40 with a world record throw of 9.77, and Marlene van Gansewinkel, who closed the World Championships with a women’s 200m T64 title.
The defending world champion van Gansewinkel made no mistake in the 200m final, where she got a strong start and kept increasing her advantage until the finish line. She retained her title with a season’s best time of 26.16, beating runner-up Marissa Papaconstantinou of Canada by 0.91 of a second to claim her tenth World Championships medal and second gold.
”It feels very good, it’s been a crazy year,” the Dutch 30-year-old said.
”I moved countries, to a new coach, a long jump coach, but I had my injury and I couldn’t do the long jump so I had to go to sprint.”
Half of her medals from World Championships and Paralympic Games have come in the long jump events. In New Delhi, however, she could not compete in the long jump due to a problem with her Achilles, shifting focus to the sprints where she added the 200m gold medal to her 100m T64 silver.
”I’m really happy I can still show that I’m a sprinter, although not everything went as smoothly as I hoped,” the two-time Paralympic champion said.
”Whether it is just sprint or the long jump, I will still be doing athletics because it’s way too much fun.”
Also with double gold medals on the ninth day of competition, South Africa claimed their only world titles in New Delhi on Sunday as Simone Kruger triumphed for the third time in the women’s discus throw F38 and Puseletso Michael Mabote won a narrow men’s 100m T63 final.
With a strong push in the last 30m, Mabote edged leader Partin Muhlisin of Indonesia to claim the victory in 12.03, improving the Championship Record he set in the heats by three hundredths of a second. Muhlisin won the silver medal in 12.26, two hundredths of a second ahead of Denmark’s bronze medallist Daniel Wagner.
“I’ve been waiting on that one,” said the 20-year-old winner, who had to settle for silver at last year’s World Championships in Kobe, Japan.
”I don’t know how to describe it, I’m pretty sure my family is ecstatic at the moment. I’m just amazed at my potential, I have so much more growth and so much to give to the sport. I’m only 20 years old, I will be in this game for at least another ten years.”
Mabote’s week had started with a fourth-place in Monday's long jump T63, where he had set an African record but was 19cm from reaching the podium as Joel de Jong of the Netherlands claimed the gold medal. In Sunday’s final, de Jong, a Paris 2023 100m world champion, who had finished third in Kobe last year, was disqualified after a false start, as Mabote could claim his first world title.
“I’m really happy with these Championships, India has treated me really well. I hope you guys will still see me for a long time,” Mabote said.
In the men’s 200m T64 final, Germany’s Felix Streng claimed his second gold medal in two events in New Delhi, having won the 100m T64 final on Tuesday. Finishing in a season’s best time of 21.60, the German beat silver medallist Sherman Guity of Costa Rica by one tenth of a second as Italy’s Francesco Loragno produced a personal best to win bronze. Streng’s teammate Johannes Floors, who had finished in second place behind him in the 100m final, made it two German titles on Sunday as he won the 400m T62 title.
Contributing to China’s second place in the overall medal standings, Wen Xiaoyan claimed her third world title this week as she won the women’s 200m T37 final on Sunday. With a new season’s best time of 26.70, the 27-year-old 100m and long jump champion made it a hat trick in India, beating Ukraine’s Nataliia Kobzar by 0.64 of a second as USA’s Taylor Swanson won bronze.

New Delhi 2025: Here are the medallists from day two
Ireland’s Orla Comerford claimed her first World Championship medal as she won the women’s 100m T13 final with a championship record. Finishing in 11.88 seconds, the 28-year-old beat Brazil’s world record holder Rayane Soares da Silva by 0.21 of a second as Kym Crosby from the United States completed the podium.
“It feels amazing. All season, this was my goal,” Comerford said.
“It’s not one you want to put out there and be like, ’I want gold, I want to be a champion’, but I kind of kept my head down as I knew that I had to work hard.”
Earlier on the second day of action in New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Comerford’s teammate Greta Streimikyte had also made it to the top spot of her first World Championship podium 
as she won the women’s 1500m T13 final.
The 30-year-old held the first place from the 300m mark to the finish and claimed the victory with a margin of 11.5 seconds ahead of runner-up Izaskun Oses Ayucar from Spain.
“I like taking a race and taking it on so I just took the opportunity,” Streimikyte said.
Switzerland also won two gold medals on Sunday as long distance specialists Marcel Hug and Catherine Debrunner retained their men’s and women’s 5000m T54 titles.
“You should never take it for granted, I’m really happy for the win,” said the world record-holder Debrunner, 30, who beat runner-up Tian Yajuan of China by a margin of 1.92 seconds.
""The other athletes are not sleeping; they are all here to do their very best and we have great athletes. I’m grateful to be part of this community.”
Competing in four other events in New Delhi, the six-time Paralympic champion said she aims to not get too far ahead of herself.
“I try to take day by day and rest as much as I can. I also want to watch the other races of my friends and cheer for them,” Debrunner said.
“I’m looking forward to competing in the next event, but first of all, enjoy this moment.”
Jaydin Blackwell and Ryan Medrano produced a one-two for the United States in the men’s 100m T38 final. World record-holder Blackwell, 21, flew off the starting blocks and was unbeatable after a strong first 40m push.
Claiming the gold medal in a championship record time of 10.70, he beat his teammate by two tenths of a second as Thomas Young of Great Britain won bronze.
“It feels really good to race this dude (Medrano) all day every day,” Blackwell said.
“We just push each other and I’m so glad that I get to race with someone like him. We build chemistry from each other every day and help each other out in so many ways.”
Great Britain’s Hannah Cockroft started her New Delhi 2025 campaign off in the best possible way, winning the women’s 400m T34 final with a new championship record of 55.62. The 33-year-old led the race from start to finish to claim her 17th world title by a margin of more than seven seconds ahead of her teammate Kare Adenegan in second place as Fabienne Andre completed 
the British clean sweep.
“It’s so nice to have the 400m (event) back. The last 400m I raced was in 2017, in London, which was of course an amazing ’Worlds’,” she said.
“I’m really happy with my time, a championship record. It’s a great sign, hopefully, of things to come.""
Norway’s Salum Ageze Kashafali won the men’s 100m T12 gold medal in a dominant fashion, producing a new world record time of 10.42 seconds. The 31-year-old, known for his victory dances, made a strong start and kept the momentum throughout the race, brushing one hundredth of a second off his own record from 2021 that he had equalled in Saturday’s heats.
Despite slowing down in the last steps, Kashafali won his third world title more than half a second ahead of Japan’s Kuno Ryutaro. Brazil’s Kesley Teodoro won bronze, 0.03 behind the silver medallist.

"New Delhi 2025: Markus Rehm leaps to eighth world title, pays tribute to coach Steffi","Germany’s Markus Rehm claimed his eighth long jump world title as he won the men’s T64 final at the IndianOil New Delhi 2025 World Para Athletics Championships on Friday.
The 37-year-old Para sports icon, with four consecutive Paralympic long jump gold medals to his name, produced his winning jump of 8.43 in his second attempt, extending his own championship record from Doha, Qatar, one decade ago, by three centimetres.
Derek Loccident and Jarryd Wallace made it two times United States on the podium, Loccident claiming silver with an American Record of 8.21.
In his final jump, Rehm wore a headband saying, “Thank you, Steffi”, honouring his coach Steffi Nerius in their final competition together.
“I feel incredibly happy and absolutely grateful for the nice competition today; (jumping) 8.43, I defended my title and of course, most important today, I want to thank my coach,” Rehm said.
“Steffi was my first coach and has been my coach for more than 16 years. Throughout this time, she has shaped me both as an athlete and a person.”
New Delhi 2025: Here are the medallists from day seven
Rehm, also known as “The Blade Jumper”, hugged Nerius after the race, saying, “thank you so much for the 16 years and so many gold medals. I couldn’t do it without you.”
Nerius, a 2009 javelin world champion who claimed a silver medal at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games before becoming a coach, was happy to finish on a high.
“I’m very proud of my athlete. Sixteen years unbeaten, and today was a great competition,” she said.
“We wanted to keep the focus throughout the whole competition and therefore I’m so proud that he jumped so far – a season’s best. I’m very proud and pleased to retire now with this title. It’s perfect.”
In the women’s long jump T64, favourite Fleur Jong of the Netherlands made no mistake as she won her third consecutive world title and second gold medal in New Delhi, having bagged a third consecutive 100m T64 gold medal at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Wednesday.
The 29-year-old from Purmerend in the Netherlands pulled off a new championship record of 6.81 to claim the victory by a margin of more than a metre to her teammate Kiki Hendriks in second place on 5.43. USA’s Beatriz Hatz claimed bronze with 5.38 as her teammate Annie 
Carey finished fourth with a new T44 world record of 5.20.
“I’m so happy. I was jumping so well and so far, and I couldn’t wait to get the big one,” Jong said.
“I made a foul, I’m so sorry, but I’m really proud, 6.81m is a crazy distance.”
Her best jump was 5cm off her own world record, set in June this year.
“I was (looking for the world record),” she said.
“It is a fast track – it’s a blue MONDO track. I just couldn’t wait to get out there, run as fast as my best run ever and then see what comes out.”
The large crowd at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium stayed late to watch Nishad Kumar claim his first global title and then have a go at the world record in the men’s high jump T47. The 26-year-old had won three world championships medals – two silvers and a bronze – and had two Paralympic silver medals to his name but saved his first World Championships gold medal for the best moment possible.
Favourite to the title, world record-holder Roderick Townsend of United States, with three consecutive Paralympic gold medals to his name, came into Friday’s final as the defending world champion looking for a sixth world title in the event. But the 33-year-old had to settle for a bronze this time, failing to achieve a higher jump than 2.03.
Instead, it was Turkiye’s Abdullah Ilgaz who pushed Kumar to new heights with a new European record of 2.08 that brought the emotional 27-year-old to tears afterwards. The home jumper in his characteristic sunglasses, however, flew over 2.08, 2.10 and 2.14, to the joy of the fans in the stands, as Townsend was the first to congratulate him on his first world title.
“It was a very good feeling. It was the first time in my life and his (Townsend’s) life. I had never beaten him,” Kumar said.
“I will try to keep it up. He (Townsend) is a very good jumper and a very good person. I train in the US, and he has always supported me. When I meet him at competitions, he never sees me as a competitor. He sees me as a younger brother and as a good human.”
After adding 5cm to his previous lifetime best on his 26th birthday, Kumar made three close attempts at a world record of 2.18 but saved it for another time, already having plenty to celebrate this Friday.
Also producing a lifetime best to please the home fans with another gold medal for India, Simran Sharma brought home the victory in the women’s 100m T12 final in 11.95, beating runner-up Liang Yanfen of China by 0.16 of a second as Spain’s Nagore Folgado Garcia claimed bronze.
“I can only see one thing, that the national anthem will be played in India. That is my dream,” the 25-year-old winner said, looking for a repeat in Saturday’s 200m T12.
“I want to achieve that in 200 metres. It’s fun to run for my country.""
Sharma, who runs with guide Umar Saifi, is the defending 200m world champion.
“My target was to give my best in every heat. So now, the same target is in 200m,” she said.
India’s six gold medals so far already match the host nation’s previous record, set in Kobe, Japan, last year.
Another birthday hero, six-time Paralympic champion Yao Juan of China turned 41 by claiming a silver medal in the women’s shot put F44.
Her season’s best throw of 12.81 was only beaten by 17-year-old Arelle Middleton from the United States, who claimed her first world title in 12.95, having had to settle for silver medals at last year’s Paralympic Games and World Championships. Great Britain’s Funmi Oduwaiye made a career-best throw in her first attempt and won bronze.
Catherine Debrunner completed a clean sweep of five gold medals in five events in New Delhi, finishing off her unbeaten campaign in India with a clear victory in the women’s 400m T53 final.
The 30-year-old T53 world record-holder was unstoppable as she broke away from the rest of the field to cruise alone to her tenth world title in a new Championship Record of 50.58. Turkiye’s Hamide Dogangun was closest to challenging Debrunner but had to settle for a second silver medal behind Debrunner for the second time at these championships, crossing the line with a personal best of 53.72. Zhou Hongzhuan of China claimed bronze.
Greece’s Athanasios Ghavelas has won two consecutive Paralympic men’s 100m T11 gold medals and claimed the world title in Paris 2023 but was dethroned in the last World Championship final in Kobe last year, disqualified for a tether violation as Di Dongdong of China won the gold.
Hoping to get his title back on Friday, however, the Greek 25-year-old made no mistake and led the narrow final from start to finish, claiming his second World Championship gold in 10.96. Namibia’s Ananias Shikongo came strongly in the last metres of the race, claiming silver in a new African Record-time of 11 seconds as Di had to settle for a bronze this time, crossing the line in 11.11. Germany’s Marcel Boettger finished fourth and last in 11.13, 0.17 of a second separating all four runners of the race.
Argentina’s long jump T37 Paralympic champion Brian Impellizzeri also returned to the top of the World Championships podium on Friday, having missed out on last year’s edition of the competition. The Paris 2023 world champion produced a new championship record of 6.63 as he claimed the victory, 20cm ahead of Neutral Athlete Sergei Biriukov in second place.
New Zealand’s Danielle Aitchison broke the world record on the way to winning the women’s 200m T36 gold medal. The 24-year-old finished in 27.18 to cut 0.29 of a second off her previous mark, set at last year’s World Championships in Kobe. Beating runner-up Mali Lovell from Australia by more than two and a half second, Aitchison bagged her second world title in New Delhi, adding to Tuesday’s 100m triumph.
Ecuador’s Kiara Rodriguez, who won the women’s 100m T47 gold medal on Monday, set a world record in the 200m T47 heats, making a clear statement ahead of Sunday’s final.
Tunisia’s Raoua Tlili had to settle for a bronze medal in Saturday’s shot put F41 but made up for it on Friday as she claimed the women’s discus throw F41 title with a dominant performance. The F41 world champion pulled off three throws beyond 32 metres that would all have given her the gold medal. The winning fifth attempt marked 33.81 – four metres further than Ecuadorean silver medallist Estefany Gisela Lopez Macas. Uzbekistan’s Navruza Akhmatova took the bronze with an Asian record of 28.83.
It was the Tunisian 35-year-old’s 12th World Championships gold medal, six of which have come in discus.
Para athletes from Belgium, Canada, China, Colombia, Croatia, Iran, Poland, Thailand and Uzbekistan, as well as Neutral Para Athletes Kirill Glazyrin and Svetlana Krivenok, who triumphed in the men’s 100m T36 and women’s shot put F33 respectively, also won gold medals in the seventh day of action in New Delhi.
With two competition days left, Brazil keep their lead in the overall medal table, with 37 podium finishes in total, including 12 gold medals. China are in second place on nine gold medals, and Poland in third place on eight. India, Thailand and Switzerland hold places four, five and six, with six gold medals each.

New Delhi 2025: Palomeque Moreno defends 200m T38 title in record-breaking run,"Colombia’s Karen Tatiana Palomeque Moreno retained her women’s 200m T38 world title with a world record at the IndianOil New Delhi 2025 World Para Athletics Championships on Thursday.
The 31-year-old from Medellin, who won two gold medals and a bronze at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, had been dethroned by her teammate Angie Nicoll Mejia Morales in Monday's narrow 100m T38 final, but refused to let another title slip.
With a good start, Palomeque Moreno and her 16-year-old compatriot broke clear of the field, but this time Palomeque Moreno held her off to claim her third consecutive 200m crown in 24.98, knocking nine hundredths off her own world record set in May.
“I want to thank my mother, sister, brother, auntie and uncle. It is much thanks to their support that I am here. I should obviously also thank my husband, who is a motivation for me to be here, making my dreams come true,” Palomeque Moreno said.
New Delhi 2025: Here are the medallist from day six
“I want to thank my coaches for their strength and for helping me through such a beautiful process that we have had, and that has resulted in such a great result.”
It was the sixth world title for Palomeque Moreno, who now has a New Delhi medal in every colour, having claimed bronze in the long jump T38 on Wednesday. Luca Ekler of Hungary, who topped the long jump podium ahead of the two Colombians, took bronze in 25.96.
The sixth evening of action at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was delayed because of heavy rainfall, with some events postponed to the remaining days. The weather was however not anything that could stop Switzerland’s Catherine Debrunner, who won the women’s 100m T53 final to claim her fourth gold medal in New Delhi.
“It has been a crazy day today, with plenty of thunderstorm and rain, so everything was postponed, and we’ve been really insecure about what was going to happen. Suddenly they said that we could go into the call room, and it was kind of chaotic,” Debrunner said.
When the track was race-ready again, Debrunner set off with a lightning start and soon had a chair’s length back to Turkiye’s Hamide Dogangun in second place. She took the title in a new championship record of 15.50 – almost half a second faster than Dogangun’s 15.96 – as Zhou Hongzhuan of China claimed bronze.
“I am really happy that I could deal with the circumstances. To take my first World Championships title in the 100m is a very special one to me,” Debrunner said.
In her Paris 2024 medal haul, Debrunner had won gold medals in the 400m, 800m, 1500m, 5000m and the marathon, and a silver in the 100m. In New Delhi, she had previously triumphed in the 800m, 1500m and 5000m and will aim for a clean sweep of gold medals in Friday's 400m final.
“I want to say thanks to everyone who supports me in Switzerland; my family, my friends, my whole support team in sports,” she said.
“I could never have done it without you guys and I’m so proud of what we have achieved in the past years.”
Iran’s Saeid Afrooz improved his own world record in the men’s javelin F34 final. The world and Paralympic champion made no mistake in the first event of the day. With a winning throw of 41.52 in his fifth attempt, he extended his mark from Paris 2024 by 36cm. Diego Fernando Meneses Medina of Colombia pulled off his best throw in his sixth and last attempt, claiming the silver medal with an American Record of 39.19.
Paralympic and world champion Safia Djelal of Algeria was big favourite to win the women’s shot put F57, where she had set the world record at last year’s World Championships in Kobe, Japan. On Thursday, she defended her title with a new world record of 11.67 in her fifth of six attempts, adding 5cm to her previous mark.
Her teammate Nassima Saifi, with a 10.45 throw, made it an Algerian one-two as Tian Yuxin claimed bronze.
Also defending her world title from Kobe 2024, Noemi Alphonse won the women’s 100m T54 final.
The 29-year-old, who made history for Mauritius as she became the island nation’s first Para athletics world champion last year, got off to an explosive start and kept increasing the pace throughout the sprint, giving off a victory scream as she crossed the line in 16.07. She beat runner-up Zubeyde Supurgeci of Turkiye by 0.12 of a second as Zhou Zhaoqian of China claimed bronze. Belgium’s Paralympic champion Lea Bayekula had to settle for a fifth place.
Brazil increased their lead in the overall medal table, having claimed four titles including back-to-back 400m gold medals on Thursday morning.
Bartolomeu Chaves defended his world title in the 400m T37 with a new championship record. The 24-year-old Paralympic silver medallist made a strong finish to cross the line in 50.13, beating Neutral Paralympic Athlete Anton Feoktistov in second place by more than half a second. Colombia’s Yeferson Suarez Cardona had the lead for most of the race but had to settle for bronze in 51.19.
“I entered the track knowing I was going to fight for gold,” said Chaves, nicknamed ""Passarinho” – ”Little bird” – in Brazil
“I was confident. I started the race and, after passing the 200-metre mark and seeing that I was in the lead, I thought, ‘now I'm not going to let anyone pass me’. Then the gold came.”
It was the fourth World Championship podium of the career for the T37 sprinter who won silver in the 200m T37 on Tuesday.
“I'm very happy. It was the first time I ran in lane nine, and I didn't think it was bad. I was very confident,” Chaves said.
“I can't wait to go back to Brazil and give my mother a hug.”
Right after the Brazilian success came another one as Maria Clara Augusto won the women's 400m T47. The Paralympic bronze medallist surprised everyone – including Brazil's Paris 2024 champion Fernanda Yara in fifth place – as she claimed the title in a new personal best time of 56.17.
“The whole time, I was mentally telling myself, ‘you can do it, you trained, just keep doing the right thing’, and I managed to do that on the track,” Augusto said.
She took over the lead at the 300m mark and beat Neutral Para Athlete Anastasiia Soloveva in second place by almost one and a half second, Jule Ross of Germany claiming bronze. Augusto’s time was 0.57 of a second outside of the world record, set by South Africa’s Anrune Weyers in 2019.
“It was a lot of work. Since last year, I've been working to beat the (Championship) Record, with the help of my coach, to keep improving. And I'm going to set him a challenge, which is to beat the World Record for this event,” Augusto said.
Brazil’s Wanna Helena Brito Oliveira won the women’s shot put F32 title with a new world record of 8.49, her compatriot Antonia Keyla da Silva Barros repeating the feat in the Women’s 1500m T20 final, where she erased a world record that had stood since 2012.
The South Americans have won 12 golds and 36 medals overall. In second place of the medal table are China, on eight gold medals. Poland in third place have won seven.

New Delhi 2025: Refugee athlete Atangana wins historic world title,"Guillaume Junior Atangana made history at the IndianOil New Delhi 2025 World Para Athletics Championships on Tuesday as he won the men’s 400m T11 gold medal, claiming the first ever world title for a refugee Para athlete.
Last year, the 26-year-old had carried the flag for the Refugee Paralympic Team at Paris 2024, winning a milestone – the maiden Para athletics medal at the Games for the Refugee Team that he hoped would allow refugees all over the world to dream.
One year later, the Cameroon-born runner and guide Donard Ndim Nyamjua made it to the top of the podium.
“I’m feeling very happy because when I see where we come from, my guide and I, it’s not been easy. We live in England and don’t have any support, so I am so grateful for this,” Atangana said.
“I want to dedicate the medal to everyone that I have lost in the past; my dad, my mum, my grandma – everyone.”
New Delhi 2025: Here are the medallists from day four
The duo looked strong in the first 200m of the race and sealed the gold medal with a push in the last 50m, clocking in at a season-best 51.95. France’s Gauthier Makunda took the silver 0.86 of a second behind, beating bronze medallist Mohammed Ayade of Iraq by four hundredths of a second.
Paralympic champion Enderson German Santos Gonzalez of Venezuela had to settle for fourth and last place.
“I’m very happy,” Nyamjua said.
“I want to dedicate this medal to all the refugees around the world and to all the people who live with disabilities.”
Germany produced a one-two finish in a narrow men’s 100m T64 final, where Felix Streng won his first individual world title, just ahead of his teammate Johannes Floors in second place.
In a field full of continental, world and Paralympic titles in the blade runner events, the Tokyo 2020 champion Streng got the strongest start but was soon caught up by the main man to beat; Pan American, world and Paralympic champion Sherman Isidro Guity Guity from Costa Rica.
Closer to the finish line, however, Guity Guity ran out of steam and had to settle for the third place as T62 world record-holder Floors caught up to give his teammate a run for his money. Streng took the title in 10.73, beating Floors by two hundredths of a second, as Guity Guity claimed the bronze in 10.93.
“I’m just happy. It has been a super long season and yesterday, we saw in the heats that it was going to be a super hard race and that I would have to prove a point today,” Streng, 30, said.
“I was like, ’I need to get a good start, I need to transition and stay on top of my step going through the race’. That was my main goal today and I executed it well.”
Streng, whose only previous world title had come in a 4x100m T42-47 Relay in Doha, Qatar, in 2015, said the tough competition had helped push him to the top of the podium one decade after his first triumph.
“It was nice to have such a strong line-up. You never know when the double amputees come through, so you need to get the job done early in the race,” he said.
“I’m very happy, it’s my first individual world title and it’s been an amazing season. I worked really hard for this; it’s been an amazing team effort behind me and I’m super proud to be at the top of the podium today.""
India’s throwers had a field day at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, with the Tokyo 2020 Olympic champion in the men’s javelin, Neeraj Chopra, in the stands.
He witnessed another great Indian triumph in the sport as Sumit Antil won the men’s javelin throw F64 gold medal with a new championship record.
The 27-year-old F64 world record holder crushed the competition with four throws beyond 65m that all would have been enough for him to win. His best attempt, 71.37, was nearly 23 metres further than the personal best produced by Colombia’s Tomas Felipe Soto Mina, who took the silver. Rufat Khabibullin of Kazakhstan claimed the bronze with 47.14.
Having won the event in three consecutive World Championships – including in Paris 2023 and Kobe 2024 – Antil’s three world titles are the most won by an Indian Para athlete. The winner, however, still saw plenty of room for improvement.

“I was thinking I’d throw much more. I was thinking I would get a new world record. But at least I got the CR,” Antil said.
“I was fine at the start of my warm-up throws, but then suddenly, when I threw with some power, I got a lot of pain in my neck. It was hurting throughout the competition.”
The host nation also grabbed the two top spots in the narrow men’s javelin throw F44 final, where Sandip Sanjay Sargar clinched the gold with a personal best of 62.82, beating his teammate by 15cm.
Brazil’s Robert Edenilson broke the F42 world record to claim the third place with 62.36, denying F43 world record-holder Pushpendra Singh, who threw 61.94, a medal that would make it a clean sweep for India.
On Sunday, Ireland’s Orla Comerford won her first World Championships gold medal as she beat Brazil’s Rayane Soares da Silva to the Women’s 100m T13 title. On Tuesday, Comerford did it again in the 200m T13, after another battle with the Brazilian who holds the world records in both events.
Comerford made a strong side but came into the corner with Soares da Silva right behind her. Then the Irish sprinter switched gears and pushed away from her opponent, crossing the line at 24.71 to win by a margin of more than half a second.
Just as in the 100m T13, Kym Crosby of the United States won bronze.
“The goal for me here was to try and win that 100m and the 200 was the cherry on top,” Comerford said.
“After Monday night (in the heats) I was just like, ’it’s there, I feel good, I feel strong’. The Brazilian broke the World Record in both 100m and 200m in the summer so I knew that coming out and beating her in the 100m would put down a mark. I wanted to put my stamp on that (100m) and show that I’m here to contend.”
Also with a second gold medal in New Delhi, Poland’s frame runner Magdalena Andruszkiewicz, who won the women’s 400m T72 on Sunday, claimed the 100m T72 title on Tuesday with a new world record.
Finishing in 16.82, the 36-year-old beat Spain’s Judith Tortosa Vila in second place by more than two and a half seconds, knocking a quarter of a second off the previous world record, set by Australia’s Maria Strong in 2023.
Frame running, where athletes use a three-wheeled running frame, will make their Paralympic Games debut at Los Angeles 2028 with the 100m T72 events, and Italy’s Carlo Fabio Marcello Calcagni has made a name for himself as the man to beat to the maiden Paralympic title, claiming his second gold medal in New Delhi on Tuesday.
The 56-year-old, who set a world record in the men’s 100m T72 heats, made no mistake in the final as he claimed the gold medal in 14.80, 0.96 of a second ahead of Brazil’s runner-up Joao Matos Marques. Finlay Jonathan Menzies won bronze.
Australia’s three-time Paralympic champion Vanessa Low, who made her international debut in India 16 years ago, claimed her fourth women’s long jump T63 gold medal with a T61 championship record of 5.49.
Low finished just ahead of Switzerland’s runner-up Elena Kratter, who produced a T63 Championship Record of 5.45. Noelle Lambert-Beirne of the United States claimed the bronze.
“It was much closer than what I wanted it to be. At the same time, it’s really great that the girls stepped up and that, on a bad day, it’s not that easy to win,” Low said.
“You just got to hit the board. That was very close, but you can’t be disappointed with a win. I’m really happy that I managed two good jumps to bring home the win.”
In the fourth day of World Championships action, Brazil claimed three gold medals and took the lead in the overall medal table.
Claudiney Batista won the men’s discus throw F56 and Ricardo Gomes de Mendonca claimed gold in the men’s 200m T37 final as his teammate Bartolomeu da Silva made it a one-two before Yeltsin Jacques and Julio Cesar Agripino finished off the day with another one-two in the men’s 1500m T11 final, won by Paralympic champion Jacques.
With five days left of the championships, the South Americans have won a total of 27 medals including seven golds. Poland are in second place, on six gold medals, before China in third place, on five.
Saudi Arabia’s Naif Almasrahi set a world record of 10.94 en route winning the men’s 100m T44 final and Konstantinos Tourkochoritis of Greece set a new F62 world record in the men’s javelin throw F64 Final, where he finished in seventh place.
Para athletes from Argentina, China, Iran, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Tunisia and the United States as well as Neutral Para Athlete David Dzhatiev, who was victorious in the men’s 200m T35 final, also won gold medals on Tuesday.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/new-delhi-2025-refugee-athlete-atangana-wins-historic-world-title,paralympic.org,admin,

Osijek 2025 review: Malenovsky and Vadovicova lead Slovakia to the top,"After five action-packed days, the 2025 WSPS European Championships concluded in Osijek, Croatia on Tuesday (7 October), crowning both first-time champions and household names.
Slovakia enjoyed a memorable Championships. On day one, Radoslav Malenovsky set a new world record en rout to R1 gold, scoring 251.0 to surpass the previous two-year-old mark held by South Korea’s Park Jinho.
“I knew from the beginning that I felt ok, I had no pressure on me. Everything worked perfectly and the world record, wow, for me it means even more than the medal,” Malenovsky said.
“It feels amazing because I wasn’t shooting this discipline for a few years, I decided for only three disciplines for the (Paralympic) Games. And I came back to this discipline and it feels amazing that I everything clicked and it worked so well.”
Malenovsky followed his first R1 European title with a team gold alongside Paralympic legend Veronika Vadovicova on day two.
Vadovicova added two individual European golds to her collection, helping Slovakia top the medal standings with four titles. She claimed her first major international title in R8 since the 2018 World Championships in Cheongju, then returned the next day to successfully defend her R3 crown.
Serbia’s Dragan Ristic, another reigning Paralympic champion, topped the podium in the R9 - mixed 50m rifle prone SH2. Germany’s Natascha Hiltrop, the third Paralympic champion competing in Croatia, earned two silver medals in R6 and R8.
There were plenty of maiden titles in Osijek as well.
Azerbaijan celebrated its first-ever European title as Lima 2023 world champion Kamran Zeynalov edged Neutral Para Athlete Sergey Malyshev in a thrilling P1 final on closing day.
France’s veteran Jean-Louis Michaud claimed his first European title with victory in the R7, while Italy’s Gianluca Iacus joined the winners’ group with R5 gold.
In the vision impaired events, Poland’s Barbara Moskal dominated the VIS to defend her title from Granada 2024. Spain’s Ager Solabarrieta Txakartegi won the VIP, with Petar Jelakovic taking silver – the host nation’s only medal at the 2025 Euros.

Day 1: World Records tumbled and rising stars shine in Singapore,"World Records tumbled and rising stars introduced themselves to the world stage as the Toyota World Para Swimming Championships Singapore 2025 kicked off on Sunday (21 September).
In the first of seven action-packed days at the OCBC Aquatic Centre, Czechia’s teenage prodigy David Kratochvil secured a memorable gold medal performance, winning the men’s freestyle 50m S11 gold.
The 17-year-old, who set a Championship Record in the heats, produced a powerful mid-race surge to claim his first 50m-world title in 25.52, 0.36 of a second before runner-up Mahamadou Dambelleh Jarra from Spain.
”This race was difficult because I swam fast in the morning,” Kratochvil said.
”I wanted to swim the same way in the final. I did, and I’m really happy.”
The Czech rising star had been eighth in the event at the last World Championships, in Manchester, Great Britain, two years ago, and fifth at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games last year, before taking the last steps onto the podium – and to the very top of it – on Sunday.
Behind him were names such as five-time Paralympic champion Rogier Dorsman of the Netherlands, and Japan’s Kimura Keiichi, who has 14 Games medals including three of gold. Brazil’s Thomaz Rocha Matera took bronze.
“It’s amazing. The 50m is the strongest race in our class and I’d rather swim the 400m freestyle,” said Kratochvil, who is the Paralympic and world champion in the 400m freestyle.
”But I’m so happy that I’ve won here because I was fifth in the Paralympic Games and it’s amazing that I now have got first place.”
Finishing 0.36 of a second behind the winner, runner-up Dambelleh Jarra claimed his first World Championships medal in his second edition of the competition, completing another impressive journey to the podium. In Manchester two years ago, he finished in 13th place, missing out on the final, and did not compete at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.
The women’s 400m freestyle S8 final turned into a narrow battle between Great Britain teammates Alice Tai, 26, and Brock Whiston, 28. Whiston took an early lead and held it for 300m, with Tai chasing after her. The duo came up side by side for the last quarter of the race and with 50m left to swim, Tai was one tenth of a second ahead of her teammate. She took the victory by 0.21 second, as Spain’s Nahia Zudaire Borrezo, more than three seconds behind the British duo, won bronze.
“It was such a great race between me and Brock. I’m really happy to be on the podium with my teammate,” Tai said.
In the tough competition, Paralympic champion Jessica Long of the United States had to settle for a sixth place, finishing 13.60 seconds after the winner. Whiston had not taken the podium for granted.
“I was hoping to be among the top five, as I knew it would be a difficult race,” she said.
”But it was very special to be there with Alice and also with Nahia [Zudaire Borrezo] who was super emotional. This shows what sport is about.”
In the absence of retired Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Paralympic champion Chantalle Zijderveld, her Netherlands teammate Lisa Kruger was the woman to beat in the women’s 100m breaststroke SB9 final, and Kruger made no mistake.
The Rio 2016 gold medallist took an early lead and kept expanding the gap back to her competitors, claiming the gold medal in 1:15.71 – 3.85 seconds faster than silver medallist Gabriella Smith of New Zealand.
”This year has been an emotional rollercoaster,” Kruger said.
”I've started to study medicine and it's sometimes been difficult to combine studies and training. And on top of that my father passed away at the beginning of this year.
”I remember when I got the qualification time to come to the world championships, I was over the moon, I was crying. And now I'm here, I've just won the world title.”
She was interviewed by none other than world record-holder Zijderveld, who now works as a press attaché for Team Netherlands.
”I'm really happy to have Chantalle here”, she said.
”I remembered we had to record a video once with me asking her a question and I was asking her 'how does it feel to beat me, again?’”
Now, Zijderveld is getting used to being the one holding the microphone.
“It feels very weird to be here because I’m in the World Championships but I’m not an athlete anymore,” she said.
”I feel comfortable saying that I’m not racing anymore. I’m happy to be here, I’m officially doing the media for the Dutch swimmers and I’m happy to help the team any way I can.”
A veteran still in the game, Germany’s Tanja Scholz, 41, was unbeatable in the women’s 50m breaststroke SB2 final where she set her second world record of the day. Finishing a race against the clock in 1:00.95, she beat her record time from the heats by 1.32 second. Defending champion, Ellie Challis from Great Britain, had to settle for a silver, 9.44 seconds behind as teenager Diana Koltsova, 17, took bronze.
Brazilian 17-year-old Alessandra Oliveira dos Santos broke an 11-year-old world record as she won gold in the women’s 100m breaststroke SB4. Finishing in 1:43.21, more than nine seconds ahead of Italy’s defending world and Paralympic champion Giulia Ghiretti, the Brazilian smashed the milestone time set by Norway’s Sarah Louise Rung on 17 July 2014, when Oliveira dos Santos had just turned six.
In another dominant performance, Great Britain’s William Ellard led the men’s 200m Freestyle S14 final from start to finish to claim the gold medal with a new world record. Clocking in at 1:51.08, Ellard beat his own record from last year’s Paralympic Games by 0.22 of a second.
Turkiye’s Defne Kurt, 24, is making her international debut this year and continued to break new ground in Singapore, where she won the women’s 50m freestyle S10 gold medal with a new championships record of 27.21, beating runner-up Alessia Scortechini from Italy by seven tenths of a second.
Italy won three gold medals on Sunday, Monica Boggioni starting her Singapore 2025 campaign with triumphs in the women’s 50m freestyle S5 and 50m breaststroke SB3.
Swimmers from Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, China, France, Israel, Mexico and the United States, as well as Neutral Para Athletes (NPA), also made it onto the top of the podium on day one of competition in Singapore.

Paralympian Dr Danielle Peers announced as keynote speaker at VISTA 2025,"The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced Dr Danielle Peers as the fourth featured speaker at VISTA 2025, the IPC’s scientific conference dedicated to advancing research and innovation in Para sport. The event will take place in Cairo, Egypt, from 7–10 December 2025, bringing together leading experts, researchers, and practitioners from around the world.
This year’s VISTA 2025 conference theme is “Developing Para Sport: Inclusion, Transformation, Health and Performance.” Dr Peers’s keynote address will explore the topic ""Empowering Paralympic Movements: from aspiration to impact"".
Dr Danielle Peers is a Tier II Canada Research Chair in Disability and Movement Cultures, an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation at the University of Alberta, and the university’s Academic Lead for Disability, Cultures and Access. Their groundbreaking work explores how movement cultures, including sport, art, and recreation, can be used to challenge and transform community values, politics, and inequities.
Peers draws from their lived experience as a Paralympic bronze medallist in wheelchair basketball, coach, and administrator. They co-lead The Recreation Collective, the Just Movements CreateSpace, and serve as Co-Principal Investigator on iSMART’s USD24 million NFRF project, which focuses on developing transformational health technologies through participatory, justice-based processes.
Dr Peers said: “Those of us who are passionate about the Paralympics tend to emphasise its capacity to empower not only its athletes but also persons with disabilities in general. However, numerous athletes and activists have suggested that we often don't live up to those claims.
“This presentation draws on disability justice and critical disability insights, as well as recent research on Paralympic legacies to ask: what – specifically - can each of us do to help make that aspiration of empowerment a lived and experienced reality for a broad range of persons with disabilities worldwide.
“This  talk is aimed at a range of actors in the Paralympic Movement, including Paralympians, activists and advocates, coaches, administrators, scholars, and event organisers who want to reflexively and creatively consider how the Paralympics can become an engine for increasing the opportunity and influence of those experiencing disabilities.”
Dr Peers’s inclusion in the VISTA 2025 speaker lineup reflects their global impact on disability justice, inclusive movement practices, and transformative community engagement.
VISTA 2025  is the eleventh edition of the IPC’s scientific conference and serves as a unique platform for the exchange of cutting-edge research, cross-disciplinary dialogue, and strategic collaboration.

Paralympic Order presented to three outstanding recipients,"The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) recognised the outstanding contributions of three individuals with the prestigious Paralympic Order on the first day of the 2025 IPC General Assembly and Conference in Seoul, Korea on Wednesday (24 September).
The Paralympic Order is the highest accolade within the Paralympic Movement, awarded biennially to those who have made exceptional contributions. In 2025, the award was presented to:
Tim Reddish CBE – former Chair of the British Paralympic Association
Prof. Anne Hart – former Chair of the IPC Classification Committee
Duane Kale – IPC Vice President
IPC President Andrew Parsons presented the awards and said: “On behalf of the entire Paralympic Movement, I send my warmest congratulations and thanks to Tim Reddish CBE, Professor Anne Hart and Duane Kale on receiving the Paralympic Movement’s highest level of recognition, the Paralympic Order.
“From being a Paralympic medallist to a highly respected international sports administrator, Tim Reddish has made a lasting impact on every person and organisation he has been involved in, all for the benefit of the Paralympic Movement.
“Anne Hart is quite simply the “Queen of Classification”, who has voluntarily dedicated nearly 50 years of her life to advancing classification throughout the Paralympic Movement both domestically and internationally.
“Throughout his life, Duane has proven to be an outstanding champion and leader whether in the pool or in the Boardroom. During his time on the IPC Governing Board, Duane made a tremendous difference, in particular overseeing a transformation of the IPC’s governance structures to ensure they are world leading.”
Tim Reddish CBE is a former Para swimmer for Great Britain who earned five Paralympic medals and 43 medals across World and European Championships. After retirement, he became a transformative figure in British and international Para swimming, serving as National Performance Director and Executive Director for British Disability Swimming. His leadership was pivotal during Athens 2004 and in shaping global governance through IPC Swimming (later World Para Swimming). As Chair of the British Paralympic Association and a London 2012 Board Member, Reddish helped deliver game-changing Paralympic Games. Elected to the IPC Governing Board in 2017, he continued to advance governance and professionalism within the Movement. Reddish has been honoured with multiple titles, including Commander of the Order of the British Empire.
On receiving the Paralympic Order, Reddish said: “It’s a huge honour to be awarded the Paralympic Order, IPC’s highest honour in recognition to my Paralympic journey. When I commenced my journey after being told I’d go blind I never set out to seek honours and awards.
“My personal objective was to be the best athlete I could and to be both an advocate and agitator for the Paralympic Movement.
“I’d like to thank everyone who has been part of my personal journey and wish to dedicate the award to my wife, Val who has been by my side during my nearly 40 years involvement within Para Sport at all levels.”
Professor Anne Hart has devoted nearly five decades to classification in Para sport. Beginning in 1977 as a national classifier in Para athletics and wheelchair basketball, she later contributed to wheelchair rugby and served as Head of Classification for the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation. Her academic expertise led to the drafting of the IPC’s first classification strategy and the landmark IPC Classification Code in 2007. Hart chaired the IPC Classification Committee for a decade and played a key role in drafting all three iterations of the Classification Code, including the latest 2025 version. Her tireless volunteer work and deep knowledge have shaped classification systems that are now the foundation of the Paralympic Movement.
Professor Hart said: “I could hardly believe it when I learned I was receiving the Paralympic Order. There is no greater honour in the Paralympic Movement, and I am humbled to be recognised. This award honours many more people than me. Those whose shoulders I stood on and the many more who supported me in my over 40 years as a classifier and my 20 years as a member of the IPC Classification Committee. Foremost, classification is about athletes, and that inspires us as classifiers to do our best for them in realising their sporting dreams.
“I am also grateful to the IPC for recognising classification wasn’t an unanswerable question and providing the support and resources to develop the IPC Classification Code. And last but not least, my deepest gratitude and respect to all the classifiers around the world who were and are part of the Code development and are continuing the forward progress to enable athletes to achieve sporting excellence.”
Duane Kale is New Zealand’s most successful male Paralympic swimmer. A four-time gold medallist at the Atlanta 1996 Paralympic Games, Kale transitioned into leadership roles, including Chef de Mission for Beijing 2008 and London 2012. He also served on the boards of Paralympics New Zealand, Sport New Zealand, and High-Performance Sport New Zealand, where he is now Deputy Chair.
Internationally, Kale was elected to the IPC Governing Board in 2013 and became Vice President in 2017, he was re-elected in 2021 with overwhelming support. He chaired the IPC Governance Review Working Group, leading a comprehensive overhaul of the IPC’s governance structures. As an IOC Coordination Commission member for Paris 2024, Kale contributed to the success of the Games. His leadership across sport and business has left a lasting legacy.
Duane Kale said: ""I am incredibly humbled to receive the Paralympic Order. The Paralympic Movement has given me a lifetime of rewarding and fulfilling experiences. I still remember the first time I entered the Paralympic Village as an athlete in 1996 and every time since as a sports administrator. The personal impact on each occasion intensified that drive and sense of purpose.
“Its moments like this, and the people in the Paralympic Movement, that had a massive impact which guided and shaped my journey. I remain deeply grateful to all those people who have I been privileged to meet along the way and to be part of a movement that continues to deliver meaningful impact.""",https://www.paralympic.org/news/paralympic-order-presented-three-recipients,paralympic.org,admin,

Singapore 2025: Gabrielzinho clinches his first gold with championship record,"A day after breaking his own SM2 world record racing in the men’s 150m individual medley SM3 final, the Brazilian armless Para swimming star Gabriel Geraldo dos Santos Araujo made it to the top of the podium in the 100m backstroke S2 with a new championship record of 1:54.58.
The 23-year-old, who had to settle for fifth place previous day, beat Neutral Para Athlete Vladimir Danilenko by 7.71 seconds while Poland’s Jacek Czech claimed the bronze on the third day of the Toyota World Para Swimming Championships Singapore 2025.
“I reached my first goal,” said dos Santos Araujo, who is nicknamed “Gabrielzinho”.
“It was a sensational race, very close to my best time. For the beginning of a new cycle, this is a very good result. I was surprised by the time; I barely believed it.”
The five-time Paralympic champion, who triumphed in the event at Paris 2024, kicked off the race with his trademark power, propelling himself through the water with efficient, consistent legwork. He kept widening the gap to the chasing pack until it was impossible for anyone to close in.
Finishing well beyond the two-minute mark – a barrier few have broken – to collect his seventh world title, Gabrielzinho promised that greater things are yet to come.
“This is just the start. There will be more Gabrielzinho in the pool and I hope to be positively surprised again in the next races,” the winner said.
In the past two editions of the world championships as well as at last year’s Paralympic Games, he has, in addition to the 100m backstroke S2, also won gold in the 50m backstroke S2 and 200m freestyle S2.
“These results give me more confidence, and they make me believe that I can achieve my other goals here.”
The third day of competition in the Toyota World Para Swimming Championships Singapore 2025 was a successful one for Brazil. Finishing off with a mixed 4x50m medley relay 20pts triumph, the South Americans claimed seven medals, including four gold and two one-two finishes.
Beatriz de Araujo Flausino won the women’s 100m breaststroke SB14 final with a new championship record of 1:12.61, finishing 2.47 seconds ahead of her teammate Debora Borges Carneiro who clinched the silver.
Brazilian veteran Maria Carolina Santiago, 40, pulled off a narrow win over her compatriot Lucilene da Silva Sousa as she won gold in the women’s 50m freestyle S12. The world record-holder touched the wall six tenths of a second before her teammate, who was 0.16 seconds ahead of bronze medallist Tsujiuchi Ayano from Japan.
“I’m super happy with this second win,” said Santiago, who had claimed gold in the women’s 100m backstroke S12 on Sunday.
“I was expecting a lower time, but the more gold I can take to Brazil, the better. I’m always happy to add to our medal tally.”
Italy’s eight-time Paralympic medallist Simone Barlaam bagged his first gold medal of the championships beating Australia’s Timothy Hodge by 2.17 seconds in the men’s 100m butterfly S9 final. Beating his own championship record with a time of 57.96 to pick up his 12th individual world title, Barlaam was more than delighted.
“I’m happy with the performance. A championship record, European record and a gold – I can’t complain,"" the 25-year-old triple Paris 2024 champion said.
“I had a little problem at the last five metres and the touch, but I’ve improved from Paris, and I have this important medal around my neck.”
Great Britain’s Alice Tai extended her perfect Singapore 2025 campaign with a third gold medal in three days on Tuesday. The 26-year-old, who had won the women’s 100m backstroke S8 and 400m freestyle S8, made another strong performance in the 100m butterfly S8 final, finishing 2.45 seconds ahead of silver medallist Viktoriia Ishchiulova (NPA) as teammate Brock Whiston made it two Brits on the podium.
Many in the stands of the packed OCBC Aquatic Centre had put their hopes on home star Yip Pin Xiu in the women’s 100m backstroke S2 final.
Since the 33-year-old Para sports icon became Singapore’s first Paralympic gold medallist at Beijing 2008, she has won a total of eight Games gold medals and two silver, including at Paris 2024 where she excelled in the 100m backstroke to raise the hope for the home fans.
Despite that, she had to settle for a silver medal, finishing 4.13 seconds behind Neutral Para Athlete Diana Koltsova. Yip, however, was not sad to miss out on an eighth world title in front of the home fans.
""It feels amazing. To be able to have all my family and friends coming here to cheer me on has been phenomenal. I'm enjoying it so much,” said the home favourite, who had come into the final with the fastest qualifying time.
""I did better in the morning, I think by the afternoon I was just a little bit more tired, so I couldn't really execute my race strategy. But I think it's really a lesson learned, and the next time I race the 100m I'll be able to do better.”
China’s Yang Hong set a world record as he won the men’s 200m individual medley SM6 gold medal, Katie Kubiak of the United States broke women’s 50m butterfly S4 world record while Neutral Para Athletes Roman Zhdanov and Mariia Pavlova set world records in the men’s 150m individual medley SM4 and women’s 100m breaststroke SB7 respectively.
In the third day of World Championships action in Singapore, Para swimmers from Colombia, Japan, Netherlands, Ukraine and the United States also topped the podium.
China, with six world titles on Tuesday, took over the first place in the medal standings with a total of 12 gold medals. Brazil are in second place on seven, followed by Italy and Great Britain, also on seven golds but with fewer silver medals.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/singapore-2025-gabrielzinho-clinches-his-first-gold-championship-record,paralympic.org,admin,
Singapore 2025: Golden hat-trick for Italian superstar Barlaam,"Italian Para swimming superstar Simone Barlaam claimed his third gold medal at the Toyota World Para Swimming Championships Singapore 2025, winning a hard-fought final in the men’s 400m freestyle S9 on Thursday.
For most of the four-minute race, the 25-year-old from Milan was neck and neck with Spain’s 2019 world champion Jacobo Garrido Brun, who had the fastest times from the third to the seventh turn. In the final 50m stretch, however, Barlaam made one last push and managed to edge his opponent, claiming the victory in 4:13.33 – three tenths of a second faster than Garrido Brun.
“It was an amazing race,” said Barlaam, who has made it three titles in as many days.
“In the 400m, for me, anything could happen. I could be in last or in first place, and I was surprised by the result.”
After hugging Garrido Brun poolside, congratulating him on a good battle, Barlaam said he had not been fully aware of how close his opponent in lane six had been.
“On the way back, I’m breathing on my left side (away from the pool) so being in lane one, I couldn’t really see. But when I was turning at the 350 (mark) I saw that it was close,” he said.
“Coming back, I saw my family and my coach in the stands, waving, was like ‘f*** it, let’s bring it home’, and it hurts so much but I brought it home.”
At the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, Barlaam won three gold medals but had to settle for a silver in the 400m freestyle, beaten by home favourite Ugo Didier from France after another nail-biter of a final. This time, Barlaam refused to let go of the first place.
“I went back to my old strategy in comparison to Paris and it was good,” Barlaam said.
Just like at last year’s Games, Australia’s world record-holder Brenden Hall clinched the bronze medal. The 32-year-old veteran, who won the world title in the event in 2010, touched the wall 1.36 seconds after the winner as Paralympic champion Didier, who had been in a podium position for much of the race, finished fourth.
Championship debutant Katie Kubiak of the United States continued her successful Singapore 2025 campaign with a third world record of the competition as she won the women’s 50m freestyle S4 final in 36.83 seconds.
Brazil’s Lidia Vieira da Cruz took an early lead in the race but the 22-year-old USA swimmer, who set a Championship record in the heats, started to make ground and had caught up with her by the halfway mark. The rest of the race was a race against the clock for Kubiak, who touched the wall 2.15 seconds ahead of Vieira da Cruz as Patricia Pereira dos Santos made it twice 
Brazil on the podium.
New York University student Kubiak, who majors in journalism and film, has won three individual gold medals and a silver as well as two relay bronze medals at her first World Championships, having made her international debut in April
“It is so surreal. It feels like I’m waking up in a dream every single day and I’m just so honoured to be here, representing Team USA, and competing against some amazing athletes,” said the promising Para swimmer born in the state of Wisconsin.
“It was a really fast heat, and I had some great competitions in there and it was awesome getting up to race against them.”
Breaking the 37-second barrier, her winning time was almost a second faster than her Championship record of 37.78 seconds in the heats, knocking nine hundredths of a second off the previous world record, set by Germany’s Tanja Scholz in April 2022.
“It was something that I was hoping for. I wasn’t sure if it was going to happen today, so touching and seeing that 36 on the board was really special,” Kubiak said.
“I really owe it to the people in my heat. It was a really fast heat, and they really pushed me.”
Also breaking records in the fifth day of action at Singapore’s OCBC Aquatic Centre, Turkiye’s Defne Kurt won a narrow women’s 100m butterfly S10 final to claim her third gold medal of the championships. Only three hundredths of a second separated the 24-year-old from Paralympic and world champion Faye Rogers from Great Britain.
Kurt, who had previously bagged world titles in the 50m freestyle S10 and 200m individual medley SM10, used her sprint speed over the first 50m to build a gap on endurance specialist Rogers.
In the second half of the race, the Brit came closer, but Kurt managed to hold onto the lead, touching the wall at a new European record time of 1:03.91. Katie Cosgriffe of Canada set an American record of 1:05.82 to claim bronze.
Brazil’s Gabriel Bandeira set a new world record as he won gold in the men’s 200m individual medley SM14, adding a first place to his previous two silver medals from Singapore 2025.
Great Britain’s Bethany Firth, who gave birth to her first daughter Charlotte in August last year, finished third in the women’s 200m individual medley SM14 final to win a second medal in her comeback world championships.
“I’m so happy,” the 29-year-old said after adding a bronze to her 100m backstroke silver from Monday.
“Charlotte has just turned one and to be back competing, I just want to show her that even though things are hard you’ve got to keep going and keep trying, and I hope that I’ve made her really proud being here.”
Not only thinking about her daughter, the six-time Paralympic champion hopes to also inspire other mothers to fulfil their dreams.
“I’m so excited. I just want to say to all the mums out there that we can do it, we can come back, and we can have it all.”
With two days remaining in the competition, the medal table is tightening. China hold the first place with 15 gold medals, chased by Italy in second place on 13. Ukraine won four gold medals on Thursday to take over third place, with a total of 12. Behind the top trio, Great Britain and the United States have claimed 11 titles, and Brazil 10.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/singapore-2025-golden-hat-trick-italian-superstar-barlaam,paralympic.org,admin,

Singapore 2025: Three closing-day gold help Italy finish on top again,"Italy won the overall medal table of the Toyota World Para Swimming Championships Singapore 2025, thanks to three triumphs on the last day of action at the OCBC Aquatic Centre on Saturday.
The victories by Simone Barlaam, Monica Boggioni and Gabriele Lorenzo brought the European Para swimming powerhouse to a total of 46 medals, including 18 golds.
“I feel good, I was hoping to go a little bit; but it is the last day of this long competition, so it is great to finish on a gold medal,” said Barlaam, 25, who won the men’s 50m freestyle S9 final to bag his fourth gold medal at Singapore 2025.
The world record-holder and Paralympic champion had been the man to beat in the event in which he has four world titles to his name, but 18-year-old Oliwier Krzyszkowski from Poland gave him a run for the money.
In the end, however, Barlaam opened almost a body-length gap and could claim his 23rd world title 0.67 of a second ahead of the Polish teenager, who had to settle for a silver. Fredrik Solberg finished third to earn Norway’s first medal of the championships.
“It’s great to see so many youngsters coming up. Oliwier, the Polish guy, went superfast and it was a good push for me,” Barlaam said.
“Tommaso Wulzer, the Italian, was also sixth in the world, in his second world championships final. It’s great to see that the legacy of what we’re doing is leaving some real marks.”
It is the fourth world championship in a row that the Azzurri won, but it was far from an easy victory as the United States in second place equalled their gold medal tally but only won a total of 35 medals.
When Leanne Smith (USA) won the women’s 100m freestyle S3 final – making it three gold medals and two silvers in Singapore for the 37-year-old – United States had taken over the lead of the overall standings with four events left in the championships.
Then Italy’s 19-year-old Gabriele Lorenzo claimed the victory in the men’s 100m freestyle S3 final with a championship record time, bringing his country back to the top thanks to more medals than their opponents.
It was Lorenzo’s fourth medal in Singapore, having won the men’s 200m freestyle S3, finished second in the 50m freestyle S3 and third in the 150m individual medley SM3.
China, who had led the medal table over the past few days, had to settle for a third place with a total of 33 podium finishes including 17 victories.
“The competition was great. Singapore did an amazing job in organising these first Asian World Championships,” Barlaam said.
“It’s been a long season for us – especially after the one of Paris (2024 Paralympic Games), which was very long as well, and I’m happy that I could perform so well and also do some personal best in this event. The year, after the Paralympics, is not that easy so it is great to see these kinds of results. It means that the hard work paid off.”
Boggioni had started off her Singapore 2025 campaign with two victories in the first day of competition and ended it on top of the podium winning the women’s 100m freestyle S5 title on Saturday.
The 27-year-old won four gold medals and a silver in Singapore as all three freestyle S5 events – 50m, 100m and 200m – had the same medallists: Czechia’s Agata Koupilova in second place and Natalie Ornkvist of Finland in third.
In her last race of the championships, Boggioni’s black cap set off at a high pace to take the lead after 25m and turn at the halfway mark 2.49 seconds before Koupilova. In the second half of the race, Boggioni continued to increase her lead and bagged her 11th world title by a margin of 4.91 seconds.
Turkiye’s Defne Kurt finished off an impressive first World Championships campaign with a fifth gold medal as she won the women’s 100m backstroke S10. The 24-year-old leaves Singapore with gold medals in every event she has taken part in, but her last final was a narrow one.
After taking an early lead, the sprint expert had got herself a gap of more than half a second down to Canada’s Katie Cosgriffe in second place at the half-way mark. But the second half of the race was less explosive as Cosgriffe and Hungary’s Paralympic champion Bianka Pap got closer. Defne managed to hold back and won in 1:06.95, 0.42 seconds before silver medallist Cosgriffe as Pap, nine tenths of a second behind the winner, clinched bronze.
“I’m feeling really happy about my results,” the world championship debutant Kurt said.
“It’s great to be here and to be back swimming again. I was a swimmer before but two years ago I had a car accident, and my spinal cord broke, my small intestine got torn and I nearly died. But I’m standing on my legs and I’m glad to be here.”
Ukraine finished fourth in the medal standings on 49 medals including 16 gold medals, Great Britain in fifth place on 15 golds. Poppy Maskill claimed her third world title in Singapore as she added a women’s 100m butterfly S14 triumph to her wins in 100m backstroke S14 and 200m freestyle S14.
The 20-year-old finished in 1:02.58 to knock 16 hundredths of a second off her own world record, beating teammate Olivia Newman-Baronius by 0.17 of a second as Neutral Paralympic Athlete Valeriia Shabalina claimed bronze.
“I’m happy with that. I didn’t expect to get a PB so to get the world record again is amazing, it is just unreal,” Maskill said.
“I’ve done a really good job considering that it is the first year back after Paris (2024), so I’m really, really happy with my performance.”
Aiming to remain the best in the world into the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympic Games, Maskill will now “just go back and work on the little things that I need to improve”.
“I’ve got a new coach, Nick (Thompson), so hopefully he can spot all the new things that I need to work on and then I’ll come back for more,” she said.
Brazil finished sixth in the medal table, Mariana Ribeiro earning the South Americans their 13th and last gold medal of the championships after an impressive finish of the women’s 50m freestyle S9 final. With 10m left to swim, Alexa Leary of Australia had been in the lead, but Ribeiro managed to push past her in the last two strokes.
Singapore 2025 will also be an event for Czechia’s David Kratochvil to remember. The 17-year-old made it to the podium in all seven events he took part in, bagging four gold medals, a silver and two bronzes.
On Saturday, he won the men’s 400m freestyle S11 final in 4:19.83 to beat a world record that has stood since the Barcelona 1992 Paralympic Games – 33 years ago and 16 years before David Kratochvil was born.
Silver medallist Tomita Uchu from Japan and Portugal’s bronze medallist Marco Meneses finished more than 17 seconds behind the winner, who was racing against the clock after setting a Championship Record in the heats.
In the last event of the 2025 World Championships, Australia made sure to go out with a bang as they crushed the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay 34pts world record in the final.
Bringing home a ninth gold medal for their country in seventh place in the overall medal table, a team of individual freestyle gold medallists Alexa Leary, Rowan Crothers and Callum Simpson, and Chloe Osborn, with two freestyle silvers, finished in 3:58.40, knocking 3.14 seconds off the previous mark set by Italy at Paris 2024.
China took silver, 7.73 seconds behind, and France settled for bronze.
“Finishing off the championships with a world record and a gold medal is amazing,” said Crothers, who won the 50m and 100m freestyle S10 in Singapore.
“But what I love more than any of that is just the incredible exposure that we get as athletes with disability on the world stage, doing the thing that we love the most.”
Swimmers from China, Colombia, Israel, Spain, Netherlands and Ukraine, as well as Neutral Para swimmers Andrei Kalina, Daria Lukianenko and Igor Shchitkovskii, also won gold medals on the seventh day of action in the OCBC Aquatic Centre as Singapore 2025 came to a close.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/singapore-2025-three-closing-day-gold-help-italy-finish-top-again,paralympic.org,admin,
Singapore 2025: Unstoppable Alice Tai strikes gold again — four in four days,"Great Britain's Alice Tai made it four gold medals in four days as she claimed the women's 100m freestyle S8 title on Wednesday (24 September), still aiming for more glory at the Toyota World Para Swimming Championships Singapore 2025.
The in-form world record-holder had looked unbeatable in Singapore and extended her perfect World Championships campaign with a strong performance in her fourth final, beating Xenia Francesca Palazzo from Italy by 1.26 seconds. United States superstar Jessica Long, a three-time world champion in the event, finished in third place, earning the 55th World Championship medal of her career.
""I'm really happy with that time, it's a season's best,"" said 26-year-old from the coastal town of Poole in southern England, who finished in 1:05.49.
""I think it's the second fastest I've gone since my amputation (in her right leg below the knee in 2022, to relieve her of constant pain) and I'm so over the moon with that.""
Topping the Championships' individual medal table, however, does not come without a cost, the 13-time individual world champion admitted.
""The week is taking its toll a little bit now. I'm definitely a little bit tired; I've done a lot of racing. But there's still three days to go.""
At the 2019 World Para Swimming Championships at home in London, England, Tai won seven gold medals, including five individual titles. In Singapore, she hopes to extend her golden streak over Thursday's 50m freestyle S8 and the women's 200m individual medley SM8 on Friday.
""I've got to go and swim down and focus on tomorrow when I've got the 50m free, and then the relay. So, I'm looking forward to that. If I'm tired now, I think I'm going to be really tired tomorrow evening.""
Tai said there is ""plenty more"" to come, but ""in a good way and a bad way"", as the medal haul is coming at the cost of some sightseeing in the south-Asian metropolis.
""I'd like to explore Singapore, but I don't think that I'm going to get there because I've got races every day,"" she said.
""Next time there's a World Championships in a really nice country, I think I might not enter everything so that I can explore (the place).""
Italy's Simone Barlaam made it two gold medals in two days as he won the men's 100m freestyle S9 title, having triumphed in the 100m butterfly S9 on Tuesday. The 25-year-old world record holder had the fastest qualifying time and made no mistake in the final, finishing with a comfortable margin of 3.19 seconds down to runner-up Hector Denayer from France, as bronze medallist Ugo Didier made it two Frenchmen on the podium.
Clocking in at 52.70, Barlaam was less than half a second from the world record he set at the World Championships in Funchal, Portugal, three years ago.
""I'm feeling good,"" the winner said.
""It's a shame I couldn't get closer to that (2022 version of) Simone Barlaam; but it was a great time and a great final.""
The Milan-born swimmer won three gold medals and a silver at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games but had not taken anything for granted coming into the World Championships.
""It's been a long season after Paris and there have been some physical issues for me but to be here and to be able to perform like this is very rewarding,"" he said.
""I'm also happy for Tommaso Wulzer, a new Italian guy who made it to the final, which was an amazing result. He finished in eighth place; but it was great to share this race with the future and present of Para swimming.""
Another swimmer bagging a second consecutive world title on Wednesday was Gabriel Geraldo dos Santos Araujo from Brazil. One day after crushing the opposition in the men's 100m backstroke S2 final, he was back in the pool at the OCBC Aquatic Centre with another Championship record performance in the 200m freestyle S2.
Finishing the gold medal race in 3:58.45, the 23-year-old Brazilian was 8.85 seconds ahead of runner-up Vladimir Danilenko, a Neutral Para Athlete, as Alberto Caroly Abarza Diaz from Chile claimed bronze, 18.16 seconds behind the winner.
""I'm very happy and satisfied,"" the winner said.
""The time that I got was sensational. It was amazing. One more gold medal, one more record, and there is more to come so let's do this.""
""Gabrielzinho"", who has two consecutive Paralympic Games and World Championships gold medals in the event, came off to a strong start. With no arms, he starts his race diving from the starting blocks and has become an expert in using that momentum with explosive legwork to get an early lead.
Using their arms, however, the rest of the field started to claw back into contention. Danilenko led the chase, putting pressure on the leader throughout the race.
It was only in the last turn that the Brazilian managed to shake Danilenko off, increasing his lead in the final 50m stretch.
""My opponent gave me a bit more work than I expected, which I'm also happy to see. I'm always thinking of development, and it is nice to see that the opponents are also improving. This is very good and important for the low classes,"" dos Santos Araujo said.
""But I knew very well what to do, I am very well-trained and it just goes to show that whatever happens that makes it harder, I know the keys to make it easier and achieve the results I want. That's what I did today and I'm very happy. This medal will be well celebrated.""
In the past two editions of the world championships, as well as at last year's Paralympic Games, he has, in addition to the 100m backstroke S2 and 200m freestyle S2, also won gold in the 50m backstroke S2. The Brazilian is full of confidence as he aims to complete the hat trick in the final event on Friday.
""Two are achieved and I am well on the way to the third,"" the swimmer from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais said.
""I'm very confident and pleased. This time was fantastic and I'm swimming very close to what I did in Paris (2024 Paralympic Games). Right in the beginning I thought it was going to be very difficult to get close to the time from Paris, but I managed to stay strong, focused and it all went well.""
Meanwhile, Katie Kubiak of the United States set world records in the heat as well as in the final en route to winning the women's 50m backstroke S4. Italy's Arjola Trimi, in the women's 200m freestyle S2, as well as Brazil's gold medallists in the mixed 4x100m medley relay 49 points also won with new world record times.
China's Jiang Yuyan, Guo Jincheng and He Shenggao continued to make a strong impact on the competition, bagging another three gold medals for their country on Wednesday, in the women's 400m freestyle S6, men's 200m individual medley SM5 and women's 200m individual medley SM5 respectively.
With three gold medals each so far in the competition, Jiang, Guo and He are some of the main contributors as China top the medal table with 15 gold medals, followed by Italy and Great Britain, both on 10.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/singapore-2025-unstoppable-alice-tai-strikes-gold-again-four-four-days,paralympic.org,admin,

Singapore 2025: Yip Pin Xiu claims first world title on home ground,"The OCBC Aquatic Centre exploded in joy on the sixth day of the Toyota World Para Swimming Championships Singapore 2025 as home favourite Yip Pin Xiu won the 50m backstroke S2 gold medal on Friday.
The 33-year-old Singaporean Para sports icon, who had won her country’s first Paralympic gold medal at the Beijing 2008 Games, defended her title in the event she has now triumphed at four consecutive world championships.
“It’s amazing that all of us came to cheer together. Tonight, we are extremely proud to be Singaporeans,” Yip said.
Explosive in the short distances, she has dominated the event for the past decade with three consecutive Paralympic titles in addition to her World Championship triumphs, and Friday’s fast final was no exception. After a strong start, no one could match the stroke rate of the home swimmer, who finished in 1:04.31 to the joy of numerous passionate red-and-white fans chanting her name.
“The crowd today has been amazing,"" said Yip, who blew kisses to the stands from the water.
“I don’t think I expected this turnout in any form but to see that Singaporeans are coming to support and watch us has really been phenomenal. I’m so grateful for all the support.”
Apart from her family, Singapore’s President Tharman Shanmugaratnam was among the supporters giving Yip a standing ovation before the final, pushing her to bring home the host nation’s first gold medal of the championships.
“It really goes to show that they (Singapore’s people in power) see sports as an important thing in the country and being able to have an inclusive Para sport is also a priority for them,” Yip said.
“I’m grateful for the support we’ve received so far but also, down the road, hopefully we’ll grow as a nation, in Para sports as well, and that’s something to look forward to.”
And she had to work for it. Neutral Para Athlete Diana Koltsova and Italy’s Arjola Trimi did their best to ruin the party. Koltsova claimed silver 1.41 seconds behind Yip, and 11 hundredths of a second before Trimi who finished in bronze medal position. Moreover, all three podium finishers went under the fastest time in the world this year as well as the time that Yip won the Paralympic gold medal with last year.
Spanish veteran Albert Gelis broke the world record en route to winning the 100m backstroke S11 gold medal, clinching his first world title at the age of 43.
“It’s a great pride for me,” he said.
“I’m very happy for myself and my coach, and for all the people who have given us support throughout this season.”
The Girona-born swimmer, who won a relay bronze medal at the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens, Greece, showed age is just a number.
He touched the wall in 1:05.14, knocking seven tenths of a second off the previous mark set by Ukraine’s Mykhailo Serbin at last year’s Paralympic Games.
“I’m also an example for people who are in their 40s or 30s, that it is possible to achieve something. If you want to do it, you can,” Gelis said.
At the other end of the age spectrum, 17-year-old David Kratochvil from Czechia took the silver medal, 1.79 seconds behind the winner. Ukraine’s Danylo Chufarov took the bronze as his teammate Serbin had to settle for a fourth place.
USA’s Olivia Chambers clinched her third gold medal in the championships after winning the women’s 400m freestyle S13 final on Friday.
The Manchester 2023 silver medallist was the favourite to win this time, especially after Italy’s Carlotta Gilli, who had finished in second place behind Chambers at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, had been disqualified in the heats.
And Chambers made no mistake in the final. She led the race from start to finish, steadily increasing the gap to Roisin Ni Riain from Ireland in second place, and sealed the victory in 4:31.43, beating Ni Riain by almost six seconds. Her teammate Grace Nuhfer finished in third place to ensure two medals for USA.
It is the fourth medal for the 100m breaststroke SB13 and 100m freestyle S13 champion, who has also claimed the women’s 50m freestyle S13 bronze less than 24 hours before Friday’s final.
Paralympic champion and world record-holder Brock Whiston from Great Britain won the women’s 200m individual medley SM8 gold medal, completing a full set of medals in the championships after her 400m freestyle S8 silver and 100m butterfly S8 bronze.
Neutral Para Athlete Viktoriia Ishchiulova had the lead after the butterfly and backstroke lengths before breaststroke and freestyle expert Whiston pushed past with an explosive second half of the race, claiming her first victory in Singapore by a margin of 3.56 seconds.
“I felt like coming into (the competition), I had a lot of pressure on myself,” the 28-year-old said.
“No one else was putting pressure on me but after winning gold at Paris (2024), I just wanted to come here and prove that it wasn’t just a one-off and that I deserve to be on the podium. And I can’t stop smiling, I’m super happy,” she explained.
With Sunday’s 100m breaststroke SB8 left to swim, Whiston was pleased with her fourth world championships so far.
“Two out of my three swims have been quicker than in Paris and after a major Games that’s all you can ask for, so I am absolutely buzzing,” said Whiston, who won the event in her World Championship debut at home in London, Great Britain, in 2019.
“Singapore has been amazing. I thought I’d struggle a lot with the time difference in the heats but the team has been supportive, and we’ve had the best prep camp that I’ve probably ever had for a competition, so it’s been great.”
China’s Zhu Hui took the bronze, more than three seconds ahead of Jessica Long from the US – who has six world titles in the event to her name. Long, who had led the race after the first 50m butterfly, had to settle for a fourth place in her last race of the championships.
The most decorated World Championship Para swimmer made it to one podium in Singapore, claiming a bronze in Wednesday’s 100m freestyle S8.
Brazil’s Gabriel Geraldo dos Santos Araujo finished off his Singapore 2025 campaign in style, adding a men’s 50m backstroke S2 gold medal to his world titles in 100m backstroke S2 and 200m freestyle S2.
“Gabrielzinho” has won these three events at three consecutive World Championships as well as at Paris 2024 where he was branded “Pele of the pools” by French media.
Defne Kurt of Turkiye won the women’s 100m freestyle final in a Championship record time of 59.08, claiming her fourth gold medal of the championships. Great Britain’s Faye Rogers finished in second place, 1.38 seconds behind the winner, as France’s Emeline Pierre took bronze.
Great Britain’s Poppy Maskill, Harry Stewart, William Ellard and Bethany Firth set a new world record of 4:02.86 on the way to winning the fast mixed 4x100m medley relay S14 final, where silver medallists Brazil, with an American record time, finished 3.12 
seconds behind the winners.
As 23 world champions were crowned on Friday, swimmers from Australia, China, Colombia, Israel, Italy, Ukraine and United States, as well as Neutral Paralympic Athletes Yahor Shchalkanau, Daria Lukianenko and Igor Shchitkovskii, also topped the podium on the penultimate day of action in the OCBC Aquatic Centre.
With one day left of the World Championships, China are on top of the medal table with 16 gold medals, chased by Italy in second place on 15. Ukraine and the United States, placed third and fourth respectively, are not far away, both on 14 gold medals, as Great Britain have 13 and Brazil 12.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/singapore-2025-yip-pin-xiu-claims-first-world-title-home-ground,paralympic.org,admin,

Six nations set for Jessheim showdown on the road to Milano-Cortina 2026,"The stage is set. Six teams will battle for their Paralympic dreams at the 2025 World Para Ice Hockey Paralympic Winter Games Qualification Tournament, hosted in Jessheim, Norway, from 5-10 November.
This crucial event will decide which nations secure the final two slots at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Paralympic Winter Games.
Three nations arrive from the Buffalo 2025 World Championships A-Pool:
•    Slovakia (6th place)
•    Korea (7th place)
•    Norway (8th place)
They will be joined by three teams from the Astana 2025 World Championships B-Pool:
•    Japan (2nd place)
•    Sweden (3rd place)
•    Kazakhstan (4th place)
The lineup is completed by Kazakhstan, who step in after Italy, already guaranteed a place in Milan as host nation, declined their option to participate at the qualification tournament. Italy has been allocated 8th place for the Paralympic Games, with Kazakhstan taking their place in Jessheim as the next eligible B-Pool team.
The Qualification Tournament is traditionally one of the most intense and dramatic competitions on the WPIH calendar. With the last two Paralympic slots available, every game carries enormous stakes.
“The Qualification Tournament is always one of the most exciting milestones on the road to the Paralympic Winter Games,” said Michelle Laflamme, World Para Ice Hockey Senior Manager. “These six teams will bring passion, determination, and the best of Para ice hockey to Jessheim, and we look forward to seeing which nations will claim their place in Milano-Cortina 2026.”
USA, Canada, Czechia, China and Germany have already secured their tickets to the Paralympic Winter Games by finishing in the top five at the A-Pool Worlds.
The official game schedule for Jessheim will be released in October.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/six-nations-jessheim-showdown-road-milano-cortina-2026,paralympic.org,admin,
"More than 10,000 fans join Paralympic Day celebrations in Paris","One year after the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, more than 10,000 people gathered in the French capital to celebrate Paralympic Day, meet French athletes, and discover more about Para sports.
The Paralympic Day celebrations, which took place at the Communale in Saint-Ouen, France, brought together many athletes and a large crowd, offering the opportunity to relive the emotions of the Games and share their experiences.
Seventy French Paralympic athletes from summer and winter sports met their fans. The visitors played blind football with the French team that won gold at Paris 2024, discovered boccia from Paralympic champion Aurelie Aubert, and met Para triathlon star Alexis Hanquinquant, who captured his second Paralympic gold last year.
There were signing sessions and speeches by Paralympic stars throughout the day. The public also got to know French winter athletes, who are aiming to take the spotlight at the Milano Cortina 2026 Paralympic Winter Games, which open in less than six months.
People with disabilities also tried out different Para sports thanks to a number of French federations that were present at the event.
Marie-Amelie Le Fur, four-time Paralympian and president of NPC France, said: “Paralympic Day illustrates our commitment to making sport accessible to all, regardless of background or disability.
“With the mobilisation of sports stakeholders, we reaffirm that Para sport must be visible, inclusive and open.”
The third edition of the Paralympic Day in Paris ended with a large parade that brought together “Allez les Bleus” supporters, volunteers and musicians, before 2,500 people came to celebrate the athletes. This highlight symbolically passed the torch from athletes who competed at Paris 2024 to those who will represent France at Milano Cortina 2026.
After the Communale was transformed into Club France, Paralympic athletes Arnaud Assoumani and Nelia Barbosa performed a DJ set, turning the event into a huge party. Renowned artists Paradoxe, Marie Jay and others also kept the dance floor alive.
The Paris 2024 Paralympic Games took place between 28 August and 8 September 2024, featured 4,400 Para athletes from around the world competing in 22 sports. More than 230 athletes represented the host country, winning a total of 75 medals – 19 gold, 28 silver and 28 bronze.
The Milano Cortina 2026 Paralympic Winter Games will be held from 6-15 March 2026.",https://www.paralympic.org/news/thousands-paralympic-day-paris-celebrate-anniversary,paralympic.org,admin,
Japan’s wheelchair tennis star Tokito Oda completes Golden Slam at age 19,"Japanese wheelchair tennis star Tokito Oda has completed the career Golden Slam after a dramatic victory at the US Open. The 19-year-old top seed was pushed to the limit by Argentina’s No. 4 seed Gustavo Fernandez, but Oda survived multiple match points to claim a historic win.
With a 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(11) triumph, Oda became the youngest player ever to achieve the career Golden Slam, winning all four Grand Slam titles and the gold medal at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.
He is only the fourth wheelchair tennis player to achieve this feat and joins the sport's legends, four-time Paralympic champion Shingo Kunieda, five-time Paralympic medallist Diede de Groot and six-time Paralympic medallist Dylan Alcott.
""I am feeling just amazing, just happy,"" Oda said. ""Yeah, I got no words.""
The US Open wheelchair tennis singles tournaments took place from 3 to 6 September at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows. Yui Kamiji came from behind to defeat China’s Li Xiaohui in the women’s singles final, while Niels Vink pulled off a straight set victory over compatriot Sam Schroder in the quad singles final.
In a thrilling men's singles final, Oda saved four match points, all in the final-set tiebreak, to secure his third straight Grand Slam title of the year, following wins at the French Open and Wimbledon.
Oda and Fernandez faced off in the singles final, a day after winning the men's doubles titles together, beating Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid of Great Britain.
After taking the first set comfortably against Fernandez, who was playing in his first US Open final since 2014, Oda's level dropped while Fernandez raised his game.
In the tiebreak, Fernandez was very aggressive and very successful in building the lead, and when, after a long rally, an Oda forehand sailed long, Fernandez led 9-6. Oda, however, showed he was not giving up, snaring the next two points with a backhand serve return winner, and then a forehand winner.
On the third match point, a Fernandez backhand return went into the net, eliciting a roar of ‘Come on!’ from Oda and the large contingent of Japanese fans.
“I didn’t think, if I lose this point, I didn’t think like that,” Oda said. “Just thought normal, and every point my mind is always same and always just hit the winner and just hit for the corner.”
“I felt a little bit of pressure in his match point, but that time, I got two winners maybe down the line. That was the best moment.”
On the fourth championship point, Fernandez sailed a return wide. Finally on Oda’s second match point, he crushed a forehand return down the line for a winner. Finally, the Golden Slam was his.
“I was imagining this trophy and to win here and how to celebrate on the court,” Oda said.
“But that match was maybe the craziest match of my career.”
In the women’s singles final, Yui Kamiji overcame a shaky start to defeat China’s Li Xiaohui. After dropping the first set 6-0 in just 20 minutes, Kamiji broke Li’s serve to start the second and never looked back, winning 0-6, 6-1, 6-3 to claim her first singles title at Flushing Meadows since 2017.
“Well, I wasn’t expecting (that), of course, but she played so well, very powerful and good serve,” Kamiji, who won her maiden Paralympic gold medal at Paris 2024, said of the opening set. “I wasn’t really bad in the first set. I tried to stay a little bit back and hit my first opportunity to take advantage (in the second set).”
The most difficult match of the tournament for Kamiji was, unusually, in the quarterfinals, when the legendary Diede de Groot, still coming back to top form after missing eight months following hip surgery, pushed Kamiji before losing, 3-6 6-4 6-4.
“When I beat Diede, I was thinking, like, ‘oh, my God, it's still quarterfinal,’” Kamiji said.
“Every round it was really difficult to win against every player. At the same time I'm really happy that we bring wheelchair tennis level that high.”
In the quad singles final, Dutch stars Niels Vink and Sam Schroder, frequent Grand Slam finalists, faced off once again. This time, it was Vink who triumphed with a 6-1, 7-5 win, claiming his second straight Slam title and his first US Open singles crown since 2022.
“We always say against each other in the locker room, ‘Let's get everyone and then play the final against each other,” Vink said, laughing. ""Against him, my strategy is always the same, because, yeah, we don't have any secrets for each other because we know each other so good.”
Vink, who won two of the three Slam finals meetings over Schroder in 2025, had a much tougher battle in the second set. Schroder broke serve and surged to a 4-2 lead before Vink recovered to even the set at 5.
Vink then won the final when a Schroder forehand sailed long.
“It feels completely different, because three years ago, yeah, I don't remember it that good, because it's already three years ago. I was 19 at the moment, and now I'm 22,” Vink said when asked to compare his two titles here.
“As a player, I develop, but also as a person. This one was what I remember, a better match. It was a good fight, and the level of the match was very, very high also from Sam.”

VISTA 2025 welcomes leading sport ethicist Professor Mike McNamee as keynote speaker,"Professor Mike McNamee, a globally renowned expert in sport ethics and integrity, has been confirmed as the third keynote speaker at VISTA 2025, the IPC’s scientific conference dedicated to advancing research and innovation in Para sport. The conference will take place in Cairo, Egypt from 7 – 10 December 2025 and will focus on “Developing Para Sport: Inclusion, Transformation, Health and Performance.”
At VISTA 2025, Professor McNamee will deliver a keynote titled “Towards a Philosophy of Paralympism”, addressing the absence of a widely accepted philosophical foundation for the Paralympic Movement. Drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, he will explore how a coherent framework for Paralympism might be developed, one that balances values such as athletic excellence and inclusion, and ensures integrity in both competition and institutions.
Professor McNamee holds dual appointments at KU Leuven, Belgium (Department of Movement Sciences) and Swansea University, UK (School of Sport and Exercise Sciences). With over 40 years of interdisciplinary experience across philosophy, sports science, medicine, engineering, and policing, he has shaped the ethical discourse in sport through his research, teaching, and leadership.
He currently serves as Director of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Ethics, Regulation and Integrity in Sport (iCERIS) and leads two Europe-wide graduate programmes: the Erasmus Mundus MA in Sport Ethics and Integrity (MAiSI) and the Marie Sklodowska Curie Doctoral Training Network (DAiSI). His extensive body of work includes over 20 books and 200 academic publications, covering topics such as anti-doping, Paralympic ethics, athlete welfare, and governance.
McNamee said: “I am really looking forward to joining up with the Paralympic scientific community at VISTA 2025 in Cairo.  I am eager to try to navigate the concept of Parlympism in my talk, trying to articulate some key idea that might help clarify what this concept amounts to and how it might balance its commitment to elite sport and the principle of inclusion which has been central to its ethos since the early days of disability sport more generally.
“Working through these ideas I intend to show how this debate sheds light promoting and preserving the integrity of Paralympic competitions. I hope very much that I can draw on the expertise of this community to help me chart these difficult issues.”
VISTA 2025 is the premier global conference dedicated to innovation, inclusion, and integrity in Paralympic sport. The event will bring together thought leaders, researchers, and practitioners from around the world to shape the future of the Paralympic movement.

WADA publishes 2026 Prohibited List,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has published the 2026 List of Prohibited Substances and Methods (List), which was approved by WADA’s Executive Committee during its meeting on 11 September 2025 and enters into force on 1 January 2026.
•   the 2026 Summary of Major Modifications and Explanatory Notes as compared to the 2025 List; and
•   the 2026 Monitoring Program, which includes substances that are not on the List, but that WADA wishes to monitor in order to detect potential patterns of misuse in sport.
The List is one of the eight International Standards that are mandatory for all Signatories of the World Anti-Doping Code (Code). It designates which substances and methods are prohibited both in- and out-of-competition and which substances are banned in particular sports.
WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said: “We encourage athletes, their entourage and all stakeholders to acquaint themselves with the Summary of Major Modifications to avoid inadvertent use of substances and methods that are prohibited in sport for 2026. In particular, we kindly ask all Anti-Doping Organizations around the world to share the List and its related documents with athletes, their entourage, and other relevant stakeholders under their jurisdiction.
As outlined in the 2026 Summary of Major Modifications and Explanatory Notes, the major modifications for 2026 include the following:
•   Further examples or clarifications have been added to the following substance classes to help athletes and their entourage better identify prohibited substances:
o S1. Anabolic agents, 
o S2. Peptide hormones, growth factors, related substances, and mimetics,   
o S4. Hormone and metabolic modulators, and 
o S6. Stimulants.
•   The dosing intervals of salmeterol have been changed to avoid potential ergogenic effects, though the maximum daily delivered dose remains the same.
•   More details have been given about the prohibition of withdrawal of blood and blood components.
•   The non-diagnostic use of carbon monoxide (CO) has been added to the Prohibited Methods as a new section, M1.4. The use of carbon monoxide for diagnostic purposes, such as total hemoglobin mass measurements or the determination of pulmonary diffusion capacity, is not prohibited.
•   Cell components (e.g., nuclei and organelles such as mitochondria and ribosomes) have been added to the existing prohibition of using normal or genetically modified cells.
•   It has been clarified in the Glucocorticoids Washout Table that use of sustained-release formulations may result in detectable glucocorticoid levels past the washout period due to prolonged systemic absorption.
WADA leads an annual revision process concerning the List, beginning with an initial meeting in January and concluding with the publication of the List by 1 October. This is an extensive consultation process that includes WADA’s List Expert Advisory Group gathering information including the latest scientific and medical research, trends, and intelligence gathered from law enforcement and pharmaceutical companies; circulating a draft List among stakeholders; and, taking their submissions into consideration to revise the draft, followed by review by the Agency’s Health, Medical and Research (HMR) Committee. The HMR Committee then makes its recommendations to WADA’s Executive Committee, which approves the List during its September meeting.
For a substance or method to be added to the List, it must be determined that it meets at least two of the following three criteria:
1. It has the potential to enhance or enhances sport performance
2. It represents an actual or potential health risk to the athletes
3. It violates the spirit of sport
The List is released three months ahead of it taking effect so that athletes, their entourage, and other stakeholders can acquaint themselves with any modifications. Ultimately, athletes are responsible for prohibited substances found in their body and prohibited methods found to have been used. Members of an athlete’s entourage are also liable for Anti-Doping Rule Violations if determined to be complicit. Consequently, if there is any doubt as to the status of a substance or method, it is important that they contact their respective Anti-Doping Organizations (International Federation or National Anti-Doping Organization) for advice.
It should be noted that athletes who have a legitimate medical reason for using a prohibited substance or method that is on the List can apply for a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) to determine whether they meet the criteria outlined in the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions (ISTUE). The TUE Program is a rigorous and necessary part of elite sport and has overwhelming acceptance from athletes, physicians, and anti-doping stakeholders.
In addition to the documents linked above, WADA has provided, or will provide, educational resources as part of its Code Implementation Support Program (CISP), which can be accessed on the Agency’s Anti-Doping Education and Learning Platform (ADEL). These resources include:
•   A CISP Checklist – Implementing Revised List (available now)
•   Athlete and ASP Guide to the 2026 List (to be available mid-December)
The 2026 Prohibited List, the 2026 Summary of Modifications and Explanatory Notes, and the 2026 Monitoring Program are available for download on WADA’s website in English and French, with Spanish to follow in the coming weeks.
The List’s mobile-friendly digital edition will go live on 1 January 2026.

World Para Swimming mourns the loss of Mayumi Narita,"World Para Swimming is mourning the loss of one of the sport’s greatest champions, Mayumi Narita.
A 15-time Paralympic gold medallist, Narita stands as Japan’s most-successful Paralympian and the fifth most decorated female athlete in Paralympic history across all sports.
Known as the “Queen of the Water” in her country, Narita passed away on Friday (5 September) at the age of 55.
Despite only beginning her swimming journey when she was 23, Narita made an immediate impact. Just three years later, she won five medals at her Paralympic debut in Atlanta 1996, including gold in the women’s 50m and 100m freestyle S4, silver in the 200m freestyle S4 and 50m backstroke S4; and bronze in the 150m individual medley SM4.
Her dominance continued at Sydney 2000, where she claimed six golds and one silver, and reached new heights at Athens 2004. In Greece, Narita set six world records and won seven gold medals and one bronze, becoming the most successful athlete of the Games.
After retiring following Beijing 2008, Narita returned to competition when Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Paralympic Games. She competed at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, and also helped Japan secure gold medal in the mixed 4x50m freestyle relay 20 points at the Indonesia 2018 Asian Para Games.
Narita was one of the torchbearers at the Opening Ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, which were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
World Para Swimming extends its deepest condolences to the family and friends of Mayumi Narita, as well as to the Japanese Para Swimming Federation, the National Paralympic Committee of Japan and the entire Para swimming community in Japan.
